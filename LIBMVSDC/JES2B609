***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THE PURPOSE OF THIS AUXILIARY COMMAND IS TO PRINT THE NAMES
*         OF ANY MODIFICATION ROUTINES THAT HAVE BEEN DISABLED AS A
*         CONSEQUENCE OF ERRORS.  ( INTERNALLY DETECTED ERRORS WILL
*         TRIGGER THE UDUMP SERVICE ROUTINE TO DISABLE THE ASSOCIATED
*         MRCB, WHILE GENUINE ABENDS WILL BE INTERCEPTED BY OUR ESTAE
*         WHICH WILL IN TURN DISABLE THE ASSOCIATED MRCB ).
*        NOTE THAT AS PART OF OUR DESIGN PHILOSOPHY JES WILL RECOVER FROM
*         ERRORS ( WITHIN OUR MODIFICATIONS ), AND WILL 'SWITCH OFF' THE
*         OFFENDING ROUITNE.  THUS, IT IS ADVISABLE TO BE ABLE TO
*         INTERROGATE THE SYSTEM PERIODICALLY TO ENSURE THAT AN ERROR
          MESSAGE HAS NOT BEEN MISSED BY THE OPERATORS.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        SCAN THE MRCB'S ( IN THE AHCT ), AND ISSUE A MESSAGE TO IDENTIFY
          EVERY ROUTINE THAT IS FLAGGED AS DISABLED DUE TO AN ERROR.
