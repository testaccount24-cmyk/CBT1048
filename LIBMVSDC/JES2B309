***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        TO PREVENT THE POSSIBILITY OF AN OPERATOR INADVERTENTLY
*         PURGING A LARGE NUMBER OF JOBS BY INCORRECTLY ENTERING A RANGE
*         OF NUMBERS IN THE $P AND $C COMMANDS, WE DO NOT ALLOW A RANGE TO
*         BE SPECIFIED.
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THIS WAS MODIFICATION NUMBER 'M045' ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        WITHIN THE AUXILIARY COMMAND PROCESSOR ( SEE JES2B002 ), INTERCEPT
*         COMMANDS OF THE FORM '$PJ' AND '$CJ'.  IF A RANGE OF JOB NUMBERS
*         IS NOT SPECIFIED, SET THE COND CODE IN THE PSW LOW AND RETURN TO
*         JES2 FOR NORMAL PROCESSING.  IF A RANGE OF JOB NUMBERS IS SPECIFIED
*         THEN ISSUE THE MESSAGE
*              HSPB309 JOB RANGE NOT ALLOWED - DELETED
*         AND MODIFY THE COMMAND BY DELETING THE RANGE, LEAVING ONLY THE
*         STARTING NUMBER. SET THE PSW COND CODE LOW SO THAT JES2 WILL
*         PROCESS THE SINGLE JOB NUMBER LEFT.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*
*        THIS IS A MONSANTO JES2 MODIFICATION DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT
*        INITIALISATION TIME UPON REQUEST VIA AN 'EXIT=' CONTROL CARD.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        ENTER $PJ1-9999 AND PRAY (DON'T PRAY IF YOU ARE USING A TEST
*         SYSTEM).
