***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THIS MODIFICATION IMPOSES AN ADDITIONAL LEVEL OF HOLD WITHIN THE
*         SYSTEM BY MAKING JOBS INELIGIBLE FOR SELECTION BY THE $QGET
*         ROUTINE IF THE JOB HAS BEEN HELD BY A $KEEP COMMAND ( JES2B314 ).
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THIS WAS PART OF MODIFICATIONS 'M022/M023' ).
*
*        $K'JOBNAME' / $KJNNN / $KSNNN / $KTNNN  ( ALSO NNN-NNN )
*
*         SET JOB(S) IN A 'KEEP' HOLD STATUS.
*         COMMAND ACCEPTED ONLY FROM LOCAL CONSOLE.
*
*        $F'JOBNAME' / $FJNNN / $FSNNN / $FTNNN  ( ALSO NNN-NNN )
*
*         FREE JOB(S) FROM A 'KEEP' HOLD STATUS.
*         COMMAND ACCEPTED ONLY FROM LOCAL CONSOLE.
*
*        $U'JOBNAME' / $UJNNN / $USNNN / $UTNNN  ( ALSO NNN-NNN )
*
*         SET JOB(S) IN AN 'USER' HOLD STATUS.
*         COMMAND ACCEPTED FROM ANY CONSOLE.
*
*        $R'JOBNAME' / $RJNNN / $RSNNN / $RTNNN  ( ALSO NNN-NNN )
*
*         RELEASE JOB(S) FROM AN 'USER' HOLD STATUS.
