***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THIS ROUTINE IS A SERVICE ROUTINE THAT IS INVOKED WHEN A MODIFICATION
*         ROUTINE DETECTS AN ERROR.  ITS PURPOSE IS TO WARN THE OPERATOR OF
*         NATURE OF THE ERROR AND THE NAME OF THE ROUTINE IN ERROR, TO DISABLE
*         THE ROUTINE IN ERROR, AND TO PRESERVE PERTINENT DEBUGGING INFORMATION
*         FOR THE 'SDUMP' ROUTINE ( CONTROLLED BY ONE OF OUR ADDITIONAL PCE'S ).
*         IT POSTS THE SDUMP PCE FOR WORK, AND RETURNS TO THE CALLER.
*
*        THIS ROUTINE DOES NOT IMMEDIATELY ISSUE AN SDUMP ITSELF TO ALLOW
*         FOR THE CASES WHERE THE ORIGINATING JES ROUTINE THAT ISSUED THE $CBAL
*         MAY NOT GO INTO ANY FORM OF WAIT.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        1. LOCATE THE MRCB OF THE ROUTINE IN ERROR ( FROM THE APCEMRCB FIELD
*           IN THE CURRENT PRIMARY APCE ) AND FLAG THAT AN ERROR HAS OCCURRED,
*           AND 'DISABLE' THE ROUTINE BY ALTERING THE MRCBAV CHARACTER.
*        2. ACQUIRE A SECONDARY APCE, AND STORE IN IT ALL PERTINENT INFORMATION
*           ( SUCH AS REGISTER CONTENTS AT TIME OF ERROR, NAME OF ROUTINE IN
*           ERROR, APCE ADDRESSES, ETC ).
*        3. PASS THE SECONDARY APCE TO THE AHCTERR PENDING CHAIN ( FOR
*           SUBSEQUENT RETRIEVAL BY THE SDUMP PCE-CONTROLLED ROUTINE ).
*        4. ISSUE A MESSAGE TO THE OPERATOR IDENTIFYING THE TYPE OF THE ERROR
*           AND THE NAME OF THE ROUTINE IN ERROR ( BUT ONLY IF A CMB IS
*           AVAILABLE: DO NOT WAIT FOR ONE ).
*        5. POST THE SDUMP PCE FOR WORK.
*        6. RETURN TO THE CALLER.
