***(ABSTRACT)
*
*     SPECIFIED REMOTES WILL BE ISSUED JOB START,END, AND
*       JCL ERROR MESSAGES FOR JOBS SUBMITTED FROM THEIR LOCATION.
*       THESE MESSAGES ALLOW THE REMOTE OPERATOR TO BETTER CONTROL
*       HIS PRODUCTION JOB STREAMS.
*     THE FOLLOWING INFO WILL BE DISPLAYED:
*
*              JOB NUMBER AND NAME
*              JOB CLASS AND PRIO
*              'STARTED'
*              'ENDED'   - JCL ERROR
*                        - ABENDED
*                        - CC=XXXX (CONDITION CODE)
*                        - CANCELLED
*
*        ( THIS IS ST.LOUIS MODIFICATION NUMBER 'J602' ).

****(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*  1     HASPINIT WILL RECOGNIZE THE 'EMSG=YES' PARM IN THE REMOTE
*              DEFINITION CARD AND SET A FLAG IN THE RATTLE FOR THIS
*              REMOTE.
*  2     HASPXEQ WILL, UPON JOB INITIATION, LOCATE THE RATTLE FOR THE
*              REMOTE FROM WHICH THE JOB WAS SUBMITTED. IF THE EXECUTION
*              MSG FLAG IS ON, A 'JOB STARTED' MSG IS ISSUED TO THE RMT.
*  3     HASPXEQ WILL, UPON JOB TERMINATION, LOCATE THE RATTLE FOR THE
*              REMOTE FROM WHICH THE JOB WAS SUBMITTED. IF THE EXECUTION
*              MSG FLAG IS ON, A 'JOB ENDED' MSG IS ISSUED TO THE RMT.
*              THE ENDED MSG WILL INCLUDE TEXT TO INDICATE AN ABEND
*              OR JCL-ERROR AS INDICATED BY INFO COLLECTED IN THE JCT.
*
*  4     HASPEMSG, RMT EXECUTION MESSAGE PROCESSOR, WILL BE ADDED             QS
*              TO HANDLE MESSAGES ISSUED FROM A CPU OTHER THAN THE            QS
*              ONE TO WHICH A REMOTE IS CONNECTED. (SHARED SPOOL              QS
*                STANDARD JES/2 WOULD RELAY THE MSG VIA THE RMT MSG           QS
*                 SPOOL AREA AND 'PRINT' THE MSG ON THE REMOTES               QS
*                 PRINTER AS IT BECAME AVAILABLE)                             QS
*              THE PROCESSOR WILL BECOME ACTIVE EVERY 60 SEC VIA              QS
*                TIMER AND SCAN THE REMOTE MSG SPOOL AREA FOR EVERY           QS
*                ACTIVE, INTELLIGENT REMOTE ON THIS PROCESSORS CPU.           QS
*  5     UPON DETECTING A MESSAGE, HASPEMSG WILL MOVE THE TEXT TO             QS
*              A CMB ON THE $BUSYRQ AND MARK THE MSG PROCESSED.               QS
*              (THE STANDARD RMT CONSOLE PROCESSOR WILL ISSUE THE             QS
*                TEXT TO THE REMOTES CONSOLE)                                 QS
*  6     HASPPRPU, SPOOLED MSG PROCESSING, IS MODIFIED TO PRINT               QS
*              CONSOLE MESSAGES ONLY IF THE REMOTE IS NON-INTELLIGENT         QS
*              (WITHOUT CONSOLE).                                             QS
*                                                                             QS
