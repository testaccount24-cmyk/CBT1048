***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        IN ORDER TO REMOVE DEPENDENCE UPON IBM MAINTAINING
*        JES2 STANDARDS AS AT THE IPO SYSTEM ANY MODIFICATIONS
*        WRITTEN FOR JES2 WILL CONFORM TO CERTAIN STANDARDS:-
*        1. AS MUCH CODE AS POSSIBLE WILL BE OUTSIDE JES2 CODE, AND, WITH
*           THE EXCEPTION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL CONTROL ROUTINE, NO MORE THAN
*           ONE CARD OF ANY PARTICULAR MODIFICATION WILL BE WITHIN JES2.
*           ( THIS WILL SIMPLIFY UPGRADES TO NEW RELEASES OF JES2 WHENEVER
*           IBM DECIDE TO RESEQUENCE THE SOURCE, AND WILL MINIMISE THE
*           INTERACTION BETWEEN OUR MODS AND IBM PTFS ).
*        2. ALL MODIFICATIONS WILL BE INITIALISATION OPTIONS, USING OUR OWN
*           DECK OF CONTROL CARDS.  THUS ANY MODIFICATION MAY BE SUPPRESSED
*           BY REMOVING THE ASSOCIATED CONTROL CARD.
*        3. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CARDS WITHIN JES2 THAT WILL INVOKE THE
*           MODIFICATION, THE MODS WILL BE EITHER DYNAMICALLY LOADED ROUTINES
*           ( LOADED BY OUR AUXILIARY INITIALISATION PROCESSOR ), OR PARTS OF
*           SUCH A DYNAMICALLY LOADED ROUTINE.  ( E.G. ADDITIONAL COMMANDS
*           WILL BE WITHIN THE AUXILIARY COMMAND PROCESSOR, BUT BOTH THE
*           ENTIRE ADDITIONAL PROCESSOR AND INDIVIDUAL COMMANDS WITHIN IT
*           MAY BE SUPRESSED BY OMITTING THE ASSOCIATED CONTROL CARD ).
*        4. THE NAMES OF ALL CSECTS ( BOTH MAIN PROGRAMS AND SEGMENTS WITHIN
*           A MULTIPLE FUNCTION PROGRAM ) WILL BE THE NAME OF THE MODIFICATION.
*
*        ALL CARDS OF A MODIFICATION ( WITHIN JES2 CODE )
*         WILL BE IDENTIFIED BY A NUMBER OF THE FORM *B999* IN COLUMNS 66-71.
*         ( ALL BRUSSELS MODIFICATIONS WILL BE PREFIXED BY 'B' ).
*         MODIFICATION NUMBERS ARE ALLOCATED ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING
*         CONVENTION :-
*              B000-099 - FUNDAMENTAL MODIFICATION IMPLEMENTATION ROUTINES
