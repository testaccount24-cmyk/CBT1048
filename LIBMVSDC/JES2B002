***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        A NUMBER OF THE MODIFICATIONS THAT WE WISH TO MAKE ARE ADDITIONAL
*         COMMANDS.  THIS MODIFICATION IS AN AUXILIARY COMMAND PROCESSOR -
*         INVOKED AT THE START OF THE JES2 COMMAND PROCESSOR - WHICH
*         EXAMINES ALL INPUT COMMANDS AND PROCESSES THOSE THAT IT RECOGNISES.
*         UPON RETURN TO THE JES2 COMMAND PROCESSOR, FURTHER COMMAND
*         SCANNING IS DEPENDENT UPON THE CONDITION CODE IN THE PSW.  ( THUS,
*         A COMMAND MAY BE PROCESSED BOTH BY THE AUXILIARY PROCESSOR AND BY
*         THE STANDARD JES2 COMMAND PROCESSOR ).
*        THIS AUXILIARY PROCESSOR MAY ALSO BE USED TO RESTRICT THE USE OF
*         CERTAIN COMMANDS BY SETTING THE PSW TO BYPASS JES2 PROCESSING
*         IF THE USER IS NOT AUTHORISED FOR THE FUNCTION.
*        ALSO, THE PROCESSOR MAY MODIFY COMMANDS BEFORE THEY REACH THE JES2
*         PROCESSOR.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        WITHIN THE JES2 COMMAND PROCESSOR, PRIOR TO JES2 ATTEMPTING TO
*         RECOGNISE THE COMMAND, INVOKE THE AUXILIARY PROCESSOR BY :-
*              $CBAL B002,YES=ADDR
*         WHERE ADDR IS THE ADDRESS OF THE END OF THE JES2 COMMAND ROUTINE.
*         ( I.E. IF, UPON RETURN, THE PSW COND CODE INDICATES EQUALITY,
*         BYPASS ALL JES2 COMMAND PROCESSING.  OTHERWISE, PERFORM NORMAL
*         JES2 PROCESSING ).
*
*        IN THE AUXILIARY COMMAND PROCESSOR, ATTEMPT TO RECOGNISE THE
*         COMMAND.  IF IT IS UNRECOGNISABLE, RETURN CONTROL WITH THE PSW
*         COND CODE INDICATING LOW. IF THE COMMAND IS RECOGNISED, PROCESS
*         IT AS APPROPRIATE AND RETURN CONTROL WITH THE PSW COND CODE AS SET
*        BY THE COMMAND PROCESSING ROUTINE. THUS, ACCORDING TO THE COND CODE
*         SET BY THE COMMAND PROCESSING ROUTINE, THE COMMAND MAY BE PROCESSED
*         BY BOTH THE AUXILIARY ROUTINE AND THE NORMAL JES2 COMMAND PROCESSOR.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        THIS MOD. IS DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT INITILISATION TIME
*         UPON REQUEST VIA AN 'EXIT-' CONTROL CARD.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        THIS MOD. CAN BE CONSIDERED AS GOOD, IF ALL THE MONSANTO
*         EXTRA COMMANDS ARE WORKING. EXAMPLES :-
*
*              $? DN
*              $DD
*              $DT
*             ETC...
