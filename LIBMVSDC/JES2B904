***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THE EUROPEAN STANDARD  FOR SYSTEM/3 PRINT TRAINS DIFFERS FROM
*         THAT IN THE STATES, AND ALL OUR SYSTEM/3S HAVE HN TRAINS.  TO
*         REMOVE THE NECESSITY OF CHANGING THE SIGN-ON DECKS TO ALTER
*         THE PRINT CHAIN IMAGE, WE MODIFY THE SYSTEM/3 SIGN-ON DECK
*         GENERATION PROGRAM TO SUBSTITUTE THE HN CHAIN IMAGE.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        REPLACE THE DEFAULT PRINT CHAIN IMAGE WITH AN 'HN' IMAGE.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        SEE 'REMOTEGEN'.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        SEND A PRINT JOB TO THE REMOTE WITH THAT TYPE OF CHAIN
*         AND ASK IF THE RESULT IS O.K.
