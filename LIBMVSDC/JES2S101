***(ABSTRACT)
*
*      THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE OPERATOR TO REPLY THE PASSWORD FOR USE
*              OF PROTECTED DATA SETS IS REPLACED BY REQUESTING THE
*              PASSWORD FROM JES2. THE USER SPECIFIES THE PASSWORD(S)
*              NEEDED FOR A JOB BY USING A /*PASSWORD CARD. (MAX OF 5
*              PER JOB, CURRENTLY). JES2 SAVES THE PASSWORD(S) IN THE
*              JOB'S JCT AND RETURNS THEM TO THE OS/VS PASSWORD ROUTINES
****NOTE****   THIS REQUIRES A MODIFICATION TO THE PASSWORD ROUTINES
*
*        ( THIS IS ST.LOUIS MODIFICATION 'J101' ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*  1     HASPRDR, AN ENTRY IS ADDED TO THE CONTROL CARD ROUTING TABLE
*              IDENTIFYING THE CHARACTERS 'PASSWORD' AND ASSOCIATING
*              THEM WITH THE ENTRY POINT OF A ROUTINE TO PROCESS THE CARD.
*  2           THE PASSWORD CARD PROCESSING ROUTINE STORES THE CONTENTS
*              OF ONE CARD IN THE NEXT AVAILIABLE SLOT IN THE JCT.
*  3           IF NO SLOT IS AVAILIABLE IN THE JCT THE JOB IS FLUSHED
*             (OR THE EXCESS PASSWORDS ARE IGNORED)
*  4           IN EITHER CASE THE PASSWORD CARD ROUTINE RETURNS TO THE
*              MAINLINE ROUTINE TO GET THE NEXT CARD - BYPASSING THE
*              ROUTINE TO ADD THE CARD TO THE JCL FILE SO THE PASSWORD
*              CARDS WILL NOT BE PRINTED (NEEDED FOR SECURITY)
*  5     HASPSSSM, UPON RECEIPT OF A REQUEST FOR THE PASSWORD FROM
*              THE OS/VS MODULES(MODIFIED) LOCATE THE JCT VIA THE SJB
*              CHAIN FROM   THE HAVT (INDEXED BY ASID*4) AND RETURN THE
*              ADDRESS OF THE PASSWORD(S).
*  6           A FORMAL INTERFACE IS USED BY THE OS/VS PASSWORD MODULES
*              BY ISSUING THE IEFSSREQ MACRO
*  7           THE JES2 SSVT IS MODIFIED TO FACILITATE THIS NEW
*              SUB-SYSTEM SUPPORT REQUEST.
