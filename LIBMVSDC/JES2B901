***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE DEVELOPED IN BRUSSELS FROM A 360/20 ON
*         WHICH A ZERO WITH A MINUS OVERPUNCH PRINTED AS AN UNDERSCORE (_)
*         AND A ZERO WITH A PLUS OVERPUNCH PRINTED AS A ZERO (0).
*         OUR USERS ARE USED TO THIS, AND WE STILL PRODUCE REPORTS THAT
*         DEPEND UPON IT, AND SO WE MODIFY JES2 TO DO THE SAME THING.
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THIS WAS MODIFICATION NUMBER 'M015' ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        CHANGE THE TRANSLATE TABLE USED BY THE OUTPUT PROCESSOR SO THAT
*         X'D0' IS TRANSLATED INTO '_' AND X'C0' IS TRANSLATED INTO '0'.
*         NOTE THAT THIS CHANGE - ALL ONE
*         CARD OF IT - IS MADE TO JES2 CODE, AND IS NOT EXTERNAL TO JES2
*         AS ARE MOST OF OUR OTHER MODS.
