***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THE ACCOUNTING ROUTINE, WHICH WAS WRITTEN BY THE GIFTED MR. HURTGEN,
*         IS IN FACT COMPOSED OF A NUMBER OF ROUTINES, ZAPS, COPIES ETC.
*         EACH OF THESE COMPONENTS EXISTS AS A SEPARATE MEMBER OF THE
*         LIBRARYN DATA SET LIBRARYN.MVS, AND FOR EACH COMPONENT THERE IS
*         A DOCUMENTATION MEMBERR ( WITH THE SAME NAME ) ON LIBRARYN.MVSDOC.
*         THE COMPONENT MEMBERS OF THE ACCOUNTING ROUTINE ARE :-
*                       ACTCPY01 - COPY IEANUC01 AS IEANUCZZ
*                       ACTCPY02 - COPY IEAVNPMC FROM TESTLIB TO NUCLEUS
*                       ACTLNK01 - LKED IEFACTRT INTO IEFW21SD
*                       ACTLNK02 - SVC254, SMFEXEXT, TSLIHEXT IN NUCLEUS
*                       ACTLNK03 - INCLUDE IEFUJI IN IEFSD060
*                       ACTMAC01 - 'COMMON AREA' MAPPING MACRO
*                       ACTMAC02 - 'ACCOUNTING SERVICE AREA' MAPPING MACRO
*                       ACTMAC03 - COMPUTE CSECT LENGTH IN DECIMAL
*                       ACTZAP01 - ADD 'MC' TO NIP ROUTINE TABLE
*                       ACTZAP02 - ISSUE SVC254 IN IEFSD263
*                       ACTZAP03 - MODIFY IEANUC01 IEA0TI00
*                       IEAVNPMC - ADDITIONAL NIP PROCESSING ROUTINE
*                       IEFACTRT - BASIC SMF ACCOUNTING ROUTINE EXIT
*                       IEFUJI   - JOB AND STEP INITIATION EXIT
*                       IGC254   - ACCOUNTING SVC
*                       SMFEXEXT - EXTENSION TO SMF EXCP COUNT ROUTINE
*                       TSLIHEXT - EXTENSION TO TIMER SLIH
*
*        FOR DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT EACH OF THESE COMPONENTS, REFER
*         TO THE INDIVIDUAL DOCUMENTATION MEMBERS

***(MODIFICATIONS UNIQUE TO BRUSSELS)
*
*        THE BASIC ACCOUNTING ROUTINE ( IN ALL ITS MULTI-PART GLORY ) WAS
*         WRITTEN IN ST.LOUIS FOR ST.LOUIS.  WHILE WE CAN ADOPT THE BROAD
*         CONCEPTS OF THE ROUTINE, IT IS NECESSARY TO CHANGE SOME OF THE
*         DETAIL, BECAUSE OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE INSTALLATIONS.
*
*        IN GENERAL TERMS, THE AREAS THAT WE HAVE TO MODIFY ARE :-
*              1.REMOVE INTERFACE WITH TMS ( WHICH WE HAVEN'T GOT )
*              2.USE CPU TIME AND NOT RUN TIME TO KILL JOBS
*              3.MODIFY ACCOUNTING DATA VALIDATION AND THE SHAPE OF THE
*                ACCOUNTING RECORDS TO CATER FOR OUR DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING
                 DATA REQUIREMENTS.
*              4.MODIFY THE TABLES IN IEFACTRT IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR
*                CLASS STRUCTURE AND CHARGE-OUT PHILOSOPHY.
*
*        OVER AND ABOVE THESE MANDATORY MODIFICATIONS, WE ALSO MODIFIED
*         THE ROUTINES TO COMPLY WITH OUR OWN RIGOROUS STANDARDS FOR BAL
*         PROGRAMMING, AND MADE CHANGES IN THE AREAS OF :-
*              1.USE IBM MAPPING MACROS INSTEAD OF OWN-CODE EQUATES TO REFER
*                TO ALL IBM CONTROL BLOCKS, SO THAT, IF IBM MODIFY THE SHAPE
*                OF THE BLOCKS WE MERELY NEED TO RE-ASSEMBLE, AND NOT WORK OUT
*                IN DETAIL WHERE EVERYTHING HAS BEEN MOVED.
*
*        FOR DETAILED INFORMATION REGARDING THE MODIFICATIONS MADE TO THE
*         ROUTINES SUPPLIED BY ST.LOUIS, REFER TO THE INDIVIDUAL DOCUMENTATION
*         MEMBERS FOR THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS.

***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        FOR DETAILED INFORMATION REGARDING THE LOGIC OF THE VARIOUS
*         COMPONENTS OF THE ACCOUNTING ROUTINE, REFER TO THE INDIVIDUAL
*         DOCUMENTATION MEMBERS.

***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        FOR DETAILED INFORMATION REGARDING THE INSTALLATION OF THE VARIOUS
*         COMPONENTS OF THE ACCOUNTING ROUTINE, REFER TO THE INDIVIDUAL
*         DOCUMENTATION MEMBERS.
