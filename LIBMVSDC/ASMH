***(ABSTRACT)
*
*     1. THE COMPILER IS TO BE INSTALLED WITH DEFAULT OPTIONS.
*     2. THE DDNAME FOR ASSEMBLER OBJECT OUTPUT IS TO BE CHANGED
*        TO 'SYSGO' TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH ASSEMBLER/VS.
*     3. MEMBER IEV090 TO BE LINKED WITH AN ALIAS OF 'ASMH'
*     4. THE ASMH PROCEDURES WILL NOT BE MODIFIED,BUT INSTEAD
*        THE ASMF PROCEDURES WILL BE MODIFIED TO ACCEPT A SYMBOLIC
*        PARAMETER 'L=X' WHERE X IS 'BLR' FOR ASMF
*                                    'H' FOR ASMH
*        SO THAT EITHER ASSEMBLER MAY BE INVOKED FROM A SINGLE AND
*        WELL KNOWN PROCEDURE.
*     5. TWO OTHER SYMBOLIC PARAMETERS 'COPT=' AND 'LOPT=' ARE
*        TO BE ADDED TO THE ASSEMBLER PROCEDURES TO INCLUDE
*        ADDITIONAL COMPILE AND LKED OPTIONS WITHOUT HAVING TO
*        RESPECIFY THE DEFAULTS SET UP BY THE INSTALLATION.
*        (IT IS ASSUMED THAT WHEN AN OPTION IS SPECIFIED TWICE,
*                            THE SECOND ONE WILL TAKE EFFECT.)
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*              ***** NOT APPLICABLE *****
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*              ASSEMBLER(H) IS SUPPLIED ON TAPE AS A JOBSTREAM INCLUDING
*        ALL THE OBECT CODE.THIS JOBSTREAM NEEDS MODIFYING DRASTICALLY
*        TO AVOID HAVING TO SET UP SEVERAL UNWANTED DATASETS.
*              THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE HAS BEEN ADDOPTED USING MODULES
*        ON LIBRARYN.MVS:-
*             1. LOAD JOBSTREAM TO LIBRARYN WITH JOB 'ASMHLOAD'.
*               (TAPE USED WAS LATEST PTF LEVEL 5734AS1-V5.L0-PTF-F-0021)
*                 MODULE 'ASMH' CREATED.
*             2.MODIFY MODULE 'ASMH' FROM STEP1 WITH TEMP UPDATE AND PUT
*               RESULTING JOBSTREAM ON INTRDR. DONE WITH J0B 'ASMHMOD'.
*               (FOR ANY FUTURE RELEASE TAPES, THE SEQUENCE NOS. WILL HAVE
*                TO BE UPDATED. ALSO CHANGE LEVEL NO. IN LIBRARY NAME.)
*             3. RESULTING JOBSTREAM NOW INSTALLS ASMH ON TARGET LIBRARY.
*                 FOR THIS RELEASE IT IS 'SYS1.ASMH50'.
*             4. ALTER 'LNKLSTM1' MEMBER IN PARMLIB TO INCLUDE NEW LIBRARY.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*              THE INSTALLATION JOBSTREAM INCLUDES A SAMPLE PROGRAM.
*        INSTEAD OF  BEING PUNCHED OUT, IT IS ASSEMBLED USING JCL
*        THAT REFLECTS THE MODIFICATIONS TO THE INSTALLATION.
*        NAMELY:- THE PROGRAM IS CALLED BY THE NAME 'ASMH' AND
*                 THE OBJECT OUTPUT D/S HAS DDNAME 'SYSGO'.
