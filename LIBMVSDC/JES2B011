***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THIS ROUTINE IS A SERVICE ROUTINE WHICH CHAINS TH THE CALLER'S
*         PRIMARY APCE ALL SECONDARY APCE'S IN THE DETACHED CHAIN ( WHICH
*         IS POINTED TO BY A USER-SPECIFIED REGISTER ).
*        THE PURPOSE OF THIS ROUTINE, WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH ROUTINE JES2B010
*         ( DETAPCE ), IS TO PROVIDE A METHOD OF PASSING DATA FROM ONE TASK
*         TO A SUBORDINATE TASK.  THE HIGHER-LEVEL TASK DETACHES AN APCE
*         ( OR A CHAIN OF APCES ), AND THE SUBORDINATE ROUTINE ( INVOKED VIA
*         $CBAL BY THE HIGHER-LEVEL ROUTINE ) ATTACHES THE CHAIN.
*        SEE THE ABSTRACT FOR JES2B010 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        1. EXAMINE THE CHAIN OF SECONDARY APCE'S POINTED TO BY THE CALLER,
*           AND CHAIN THE APCE'S TO THE CALLER'S PRIMARY APCE.  THE SECONDARY
*           APCE'S ARE REMOVED FROM THE FREE-FLOATING CHAIN ONE AT A TIME,
*           AND ADDED TO THE PRIMARY'S SECONDARY CHAIN USING APCESNXT AS THE
*           ANCHOR OF A PUSH-DOWN STACK.
*        2. UPON RETURN TO THE CALLER, SET IN REG1 THE NUMBER OF SECONDARY
*           APCE'S THAT HAVE BEEN ATTACHED.
