***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THIS ROUTINE IS A SERVICE ROUTINE THAT DETACHES A SECONDARY APCE
*         FROM THE CALLER'S PRIMARY APCE, AND RETURNS THE ADDRESS OF THE
*         SECONDARY APCE IN REG1.
*        THE PURPOSE OF THIS ROUTINE, WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH ROUTINE JES2B011
*         ( ATTAPCE ), IS TO PROVIDE A MECHANISM OF PASSING DATA TO A
*         SUBORDINATE ROUTINE ( I.E. A ROUTINE INVOKED DIRECTLY BY THE
*         CURRENT ROUTINE VIA A $CBAL ).
*        NOTE THAT DETACHING A SECONDARY APCE LEAVES IT FLOATING IN LIMBO:
*         IT IS NOT ON ANY APCE CHAINS.  CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT
*         FOR EVERY DETACH THERE IS AN ATTACH ( IN THE SUBORDINATE ROUTINE )
*         OR WE WILL RAPIDLY RUN OUT OF AVAILABLE APCE'S ( WHICH WOULD TEND
*         TO BE DISASTROUS, SINCE APCE ACQUISITION ROUTINES ALWAYS ASSUME
*         THAT ONE IS AVAILABLE ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        1. DETERMINE WHETHER REG1 POINTS AT THE NAME OF THE APCE TO BE
*           DETACHED OR CONTAINS THE ( COMPLEMENTED ) ADDRESS OF THE APCE
*           TO BE DETACHED.
*        2. IF REG1 POINTS AT THE NAME, LOCATE THE ADDRESS OF THE APCE.
*        3. DECHAIN THE APCE FROM THE CALLER'S PRIMARY APCE.
*        4. DETERMINE IF ANY SECONDARY APCE'S ARE LEFT CHAINED TO THE CALLER'S
*           PRIMARY, AND , IF NOT, SET OFF THE FLAG INDICATING SECONDARIES
*           EXIST.
*        5. RETURN TO THE CALLER WITH REG1 CONTAINING THE ADDRESS OF THE APCE
*
*        NOTE THAT REG1 MAY POINT AT THE CONSTANT 'ALL ', IN WHICH CASE ALL
*         SECONDARY APCE'S BELONGING TO THE CALLER ARE DECHAINED ( BUT ARE
*         LEFT CHAINED TOGETHER ), AND UPON RETURN REG1 CONTAINS THE ADDRESS
*         OF THE SECONDARY APCE AT THE HEAD OF THE CHAIN.
