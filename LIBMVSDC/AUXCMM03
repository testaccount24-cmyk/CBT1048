***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THIS COMMAND PRODUCES MESSAGES IDENTIFYING ALL TASKS THAT ARE
*         WAITING, AND THE RESOURCES THAT THEY ARE WAITING UPON.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        THE ROUTINE IS INVOKED BY THE SECONDARY COMMAND ROUTER,
*        AUXCMM01, WHEN IT ENCOUNTERS THE 'DD WAIT,...' COMMAND. AS
*        PARAMETERS, THE MODULE EXPECTS ONE OR MORE SCAN DESCRIPTOR
*        BLOCKS DESCRIBING ANY ADDITIONAL OPERANDS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN
*        CODED.
*          IF THE OPERAND IS '?', THE QUERY RESPONSE ROUTINE IS INVOKED
*        TO LIST THE VALID OPERANDS. CURRENTLY, THE ONLY VALID OPERAND
*        IS A '?'.
*          THE ROUTINE EXAMINES EACH ADDRESS SPACE IN TURN BY SCANNING
*        ALL THE ENTRIES IN THE ADDRESS SPACE VECTOR TABLE. EACH ASCB
*        IS TESTED FOR READY WORK AND, IF NONE IS FOUND, THE MODULE TESTS
*        VARIOUS SYSTEM CONTROL BLOCKS TO FIND OUT WHY. AREAS EXAMINED
*        ARE: REAL STORAGE, PAGING I/O, OPERATOR REPLIES, ALLOCATION,
*        I/O, AND ENQ'S.
*          ANY ADDRESS SPACE FOUND WAITING ON ANY OF THE ABOVE IS
*        REPORTED ON.
*          FOR ALL ADDRESS SPACES WHICH ARE SWAPPED OUT, THE ROUTINES
*        REPORTS THE SWAP OUT REASON CODE FROM THE OUCB.
*          ALL OUTPUT IS PERFORMED BY USING THE 'LOADMSG' & 'OUTPUT'
*        MACROS WHICH BUILD AN OUTPUT CHAIN & PASS IT TO AUXCMM00 TO
*        HAVE THE OUTPUT DONE.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        INSTALLATION OF THIS MODULE IS IDENTICAL TO THAT OF AUXCMM02
