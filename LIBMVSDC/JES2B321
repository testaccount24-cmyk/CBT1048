***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        IN ORDER TO ALLOW ADDITIONAL TYPES OF HOLD PROCESSING, WE HAVE
*         DEFINED AN ADDITIONAL BYTE OF AUXILIARY HOLD FLAGS IN OUR
*         EXTENSION TO THE JQE ( AJQEHOLD ).  TO FACILITATE SUCH EXTRA HOLD
*         PROCESSING, ONE FLAG IN THIS ADDITIONAL FLAG BYTE HAS BEEN DEFINED
*         AS THE 'PRIMARY AUXILIARY HOLD FLAG', AND IS SET ON WHENEVER ONE
*         OF THE OTHER ( SECONDARY AUXILIARY HOLD ) FLAGS IS SET ON.
*
*        THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO IGNORE $A PROCESSING FOR
*         ANY JOB WHICH HAS THIS PRIMARY FLAG ( 'AJQFPHLD' ) ON.  WHEN THE
*         LAST SECONDARY AUXILIARY HOLD FLAG HAS BEEN SET OFF, THEN THE PRIMARY
*         HOLD FLAG WILL ALSO BE SET OFF, AND THE JOB WILL AGAIN BE ELIGIBLE
*         FOR $A PROCESSING.
*
*        NOTE THAT WHENEVER A SECONDARY AUXILIARY HOLD FLAG IS SET ON, THEN
*         BOTH THE PRIMARY AUXILIARY HOLD FLAG AND THE NORMAL JES2 HOLD FLAG
*         ( JQEHOLD1 ) WILL BE SET ON, WHILE THE AUXILIARY HOLD FLAG 'AJQFHLD1'
*         WILL ALSO BE SET ON IF THE JOB IS ALREADY IN JES2 HOLD STATUS ( SO
*         THAT AFTER THE ADDITIONAL HOLD PROCESSING HAS BEEN COMPLETED, THE
*         JOB MAY BE RESTORED TO ITS TRUE HOLD STATUS ).
*
*        NOTE ALSO THAT, IN ORDER TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY IN THE PRIORITY
*         OF FLAG PROCESSING, A MACRO EXISTS FOR SETTING AUXILIARY HOLD
*         FLAGS ON AND OFF.  THE FORMAT OF THIS MACRO IS :-
*              $AUXFLAG ON,AJQEGIME   SET FLAG ON
*              $AUXFLAG OFF,AJQEGIME  SET FLAG OFF
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THERE WAS NO EQUIVALENT MODIFICATION ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        THIS EXIT IS INVOKED BY AN UNQUALIFIED $CBAL IN THE HASP COMMAND
*         PROCESSOR OF '$A' PART, IN HASPCOMM MODULE.
*
*        WITHIN THE EXIT ITSELF, TEST IF PRIMARY AUXILIARY HOLD FLAG IS ON.
*
*        IF NO, SET CONDITION CODE TO LOW AND RETURN TO JES2.
*        IF YES, SET CONDITION CODE TO EQUAL AND RETURN TO JES2.
*
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        THIS IS A MONSANTO JES2 MOD DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT
*        INITIALISATION TIME UPON REQUEST VIA AN 'EXIT=' CONTROL CARD.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        IF ALL THE JES2 AND MONSANTO POSSIBILITIES TO HOLD/RELEASE
*         JOBS FROM ANY QUEUES ARE WORKING, THIS MOD. CAN BE
*         CONSIDERED AS GOOD.
