*         SET ON THE 'HARD HOLD' FLAG.  SOME OF OUT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES
*         ARE DEPENDENT UPON HELD READERS SETTING THE 'SOFT HOLD' FLAG,
*         SO THAT JOBS HELD BY HELD READERS MAY BE RELEASED BY OUR
*         MODIFIED RELEASE ALL ( $AA ) COMMAND.
*        THIS FACILITY GIVES THE LOCAL OPERATOR TOTAL CONTROL OVER THE
*         JOBS TO BE EXECUTED BY CLASS AND REMOTE WITHOUT AFFECTING IN
*         ANY WAY SELF-RELEASING JOBSTREAMS USING TYPRUN=HOLD.
