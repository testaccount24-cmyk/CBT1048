*        TO FACILITATE DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTION REPORTS, OUR HASP SYSTEM
*         PRINTED A REPORT SEPARATOR PAGE AT THE START OF EVERY REPORT
*         PRODUCED BY A PRODUCTION JOB ( PROVIDED THAT THE FORMS TYPE WAS
*         WIDE ENOUGH FOR THE SEPARATOR ).  THIS REPORT SEPARATOR WAS A
*         SUBSET OF THE JOB SEPARATOR PAGE, AND CONTAINED JOB NAME AND NUMBER,

*         PAGES TO JES2, WITH THE ENHANCEMENT THAT IT IS CONTROLLED BY
*         A FLAG IN THE ADCT OF THE RECEIVING LOCATION.
