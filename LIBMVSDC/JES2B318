***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        IN ORDER THAT 'PRODUCTION' WORK CAN PROPERLY BE CONTROLLED
*         BY THE LOCAL OPERATORS, ALL JOBS READ FROM REMOTES ARE SET
*         TO SOFT HOLD STATUS ( WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CLASS P - PRIORITY
*         BATCH BALANCING - AND CLASS N - TESTS ).  THUS A REMOTE'S
*         PRODUCTION JOBSTREAM ( WHICH BY DEFINITION WILL BE CLASS A )
*         WILL BE HELD UNTIL THE JOBSTREAM 'ANCHORS' ARE RELEASED BY A
*         $AA COMMAND.  SOME REMOTES HAVE REALISED THAT THEY CAN SUBMIT
*         A CLASS A JOBSTREAM ( WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR OVERNIGHT
*         PROCESSING ) AND RELEASE IT BY SUBMITTING A CLASS N JOB THAT
*         DOES NOTHING EXCEPT EXECUTE THE PROCEDURE 'RELEASE'.
*        THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO PREVENT SUCH SUBVERSION
*         OF OUR INSTALLATION STANDARDS BY DISALLOWING AN ATTEMPT TO RELEASE
*         ( VIA A COMMAND TO THE INTERNAL READER ) A JOB OF A DIFFERENT CLASS.
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THERE WAS NO EQUIVALENT MODIFICATION ).
