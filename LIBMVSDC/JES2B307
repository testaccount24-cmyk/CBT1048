***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        BASIC JES2 WILL NOT SIMULTANEOUSLY RUN JOBS WITH THE SAME NAME,
*         AND, NOT UNNATURALLY, DOES AN 8-CHARACTER COMPARE TO DETERMINE
*         IF IT HAS A DUPLICATE JOBNAME.  OUR JOBNAME CONVENTIONS ARE
*         SUCH THAT IF THE FIRST FIVE CHARACTERS ( OF TWO JOB NAMES ) ARE
*         THE SAME THEN IT IS REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT THERE WILL BE A
*         CONFLICT FOR EXCLUSIVELY OWNED RESOURCES.
*        THIS MODIFICATION SUBSTITUTES A 5-CHARACTER COMPARE FOR THE 8-CHAR
*         COMPARE SO THAT WE DO NOT WASTE RESOURCES BY INITIATING A JOB
*         THAT WILL IMMEDIATELY WAIT ON A RESOURCE IN USE BY ANOTHER JOB.
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THIS WAS MODIFICATION 'M043 ' ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        THIS MODIFICATION ROUTINE IS INVOKED BY A $CBAL OF THE FORM
*              $CBAL JES2B307,YES=*+10
*         PLACED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE EXISTING JES2 8-CHARACTER COMPARE.
*         THE ROUTINE ITSELF PERFORMS A 5-CHARACTER COMPARE AND RETURNS
*         WITH THE PSW COND CODE REFLECTING THE RESULT OF THE TEST.  IF THE
*         NAMES ARE EQUAL FOR THE 1ST 5 CHARACTERS THEN JES2'S OWN
*         TEST WILL BE BYPASSED, AND JES WILL ACT AS IF THE 8 CHARACTERS
*         ARE THE SAME.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        THIS IS A MONSANTO JES2 MOD DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT
*        INITIALISATION TIME UPON REQUEST VIA AN 'EXIT=' CONTROL CARD.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*
*        TO TEST :-
*
*         SUBMIT AND EXECUTE THE JOBS TESTB307 IN THE JES2 TEST SYSTEM,
*          AND CHECK IF THE 5-CHAR JOBNAME COMPARE IS O.K.
*
*         YOU WILL FIND THESE JOBS IN 'LIBRARYN.MVS' DATA SET,
*           MEMBER 'TESTB307', PASSWORD 'T307'.
