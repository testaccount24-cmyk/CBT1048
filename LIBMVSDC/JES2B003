***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        MANY OF OUR MODIFICATIONS ARE IN THE AREA OF JOB CARD VALIDATION
*         AND OTHER ADDITIONAL JOB CARD PROCESSING, SO TO MINIMISE THE
*         OVERHEAD OF EXITING FROM AND RETURNING TO JES2 CODE, ALL SUCH
*         MODIFICATIONS ARE PARTS OF THIS ADDITIONAL JOB CARD PROCESSOR
*         THAT IS INVOKED BY A $CBAL OF THE FORM :-
*              $CBAL  B003,NO=ILLJOBCD
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        THIS MODIFICATION IS MERELY A SKELETON ROUTINE WITHIN WHICH
*         OTHER MODIFICATIONS PERFORM VALIDATION, AND TAKE THE DECISION
*         AS TO WHAT COND CODE TO RETURN IN THE PSW.  THIS ROUTINE PASSES
*         CONTROL TO THE VARIOUS VALIDATION ROUTINES, TESTING THE PSW
*         COND CODE AFTER EACH.  IF ANY ROUTINE SETS THE COND CODE LOW, THEN
*         RETURN DIRECTLY TO JES2 WITH THE PSW UNCHANGED, AND WITHOUT
*         PROCESSING ANY OTHER ROUTINES.  ( IF THE PSW COND CODE IS SET
*         LOW, THEN UPON RETURN TO JES2, THE ILLEGAL JOB CARD ROUTINE WILL
*         RECEIVE CONTROL ).
*        NOTE THAT THIS LOGIC NECESSITATES THAT ANY ROUTINES THAT MAKE
*         JOB VALIDITY DECISIONS MUST FOLLOW ALL ROUTINES THAT MERELY ACCEPT
*         OR MODIFY DATA.
