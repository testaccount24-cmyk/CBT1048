***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        ALL OUR MODIFICATIONS TO JES2 ITSELF ARE 'PROTECTED' BY OUR
*         AMAZING TALKATIVE FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY ROUTINE ( I.E. THE
*         INTERACTIVE ESTAE ROUTINE JES2B005 ), WHICH GREATLY SIMPLIFIES
*         DEBUGGING AND TROUBLESHOOTING.  THIS ESTAE ENVIRONMENT IS
*         CREATED BY OUR AUXILIARY INITIALISATION ROUTINE ( JES2B001 ),
*         AND APPLIES TO CODE RUNNING UNDER JES2'S TCB.
*        HOWEVER, SOME OF OUR MODIFICATIONS ARE TO THE JCL CONVERSION
*         INTERNAL TEXT EXIT, AND THIS RUNS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE JCL
*         CONVERSION SUBTASK.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO
*         ADD OUR ESTAE ENVIRONMENT TO THE CONVERSION SUBTASK.
*
*        ( THERE WAS NO EQUIVALENT MODIFCIATION UNDER HASP ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        THIS MODIFICATION IS INVOKED AT THE START OF THE INTERNAL TEXT
*         EXIT BY AN UNQUALIFIED $CBAL.  IT PERFORMS THE FOLLOWING
*         FUNCTIONS :-
*              .IT ISSUES THE TFRR MACRO TO ESTABLISH THE ESTAE ENVIRONMENT
*              .IT DISABLES ITSELF BY SETTING THE MRCBAVAL FIELD TO 'Z' IN
*               THE APPROPRIATE MRCB, SO THAT SUBSEQUENT PASSES THROUGH THE
*               $CBAL WILL BYPASS THE ROUTINE.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        THIS MOD. IS DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT INITILISATION TIME
*         UPON REQUEST VIA AN 'EXIT=' CONTROL CARD.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        FORCE AN ERROR IN THE EXIT AND WAIT WITH BATED BREATH.
