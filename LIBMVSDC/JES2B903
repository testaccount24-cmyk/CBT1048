***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        UNDER HASP WE DEVELOPED A METHOD WHEREBY A CARD DECK COULD BE
*         LISTED ( I.E. PRINTED ) OR REPRODUCED ( I.E. PUNCHED ) AT
*         ANY LOCATION WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF EXECUTING A JOB.
*        THIS WAS ACHIEVED BY MEANS OF THE '/*ROUTEX' CONTROL CARD
*         ( WHICH IS IDENTICAL TO THE /*ROUTE CARD IN FORMAT WITH THE
*         EXCEPTION OF THE 'X' ) WHICH COULD SPECIFY THE OPERATION
*         ( PRINT OR PUNCH ) AND THE RECEIVING LOCATION ( WHICH, OF
*         COURSE, COULD BE THE TRANSMITTING LOCATION ).  WHEN HASP
*         ENCOUNTERED A /*ROUTEX CARD ( WHICH HAD TO IMMEDIATELY FOLLOW
*         THE JOB CARD ), EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWED WAS TREATED AS DATA
*         UNTIL HARDWARE END-OF-FILE WAS REACHED OR A /*EOT CARD WAS
*         READ.  AN APPROPRIATE PDB WAS CREATED AND THE JOB WAS PLACED
*         ON THE APPROPRIATE OUTPUT QUEUE.
*        THIS IS A HIGHLY USEFUL FACILITY, AND IS MUCH USED, SO THIS
*         MODIFICATION IMPLEMENTS THE FUNCTION UNDER JES2.
*
*        NOTE THAT /*ROUTEX PROCESSING DIFFERS FROM JES2'S TYPRUN=COPY
*         FACILITY IN TWO SIGNIFICANT WAYS:
*         1. THE DATA MAY BE PRINTED OR PUNCHED
*         2. THE DATA MAY INCLUDE JOB CARDS. ( ONE OF THE PRIME USES
*            OF THIS FACILITY IS REPRODUCING, LISTING, AND TRANSMITTING
*            DECKS OF JCL ).
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THIS WAS MODIFICATION 'M042' ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*       AT AN APPROPRIATE POINT WITHIN INPUT SERVICE MAIN PROCESSOR
*        IN 'HASPRDR' MODULE, WHEN IT IS SURE THAT CURRENT CARD
*        CONTAINS '/*' POS. 1-2, EXIT WITH AN UNQUALIFIED
*
*              $CBAL JES2B903,YES=RNXTCRD(RL1)                  R0741000
*
*        WITHIN THE EXIT ITSELF, TEST IF THIS '/*' CONTAINS 'ROUTEX'
*         IN POS. 3-8.
*
*              IF NO, SET PSW CONDITION CODE TO 'NO' AND RETURN TO JES2.
*              IF YES ;
*
*              1. PROCESS '/*ROUTEX' CARD AS AN '/*ROUTE' CARD, PLUS
*                 MOVE 'B' TO JCTMCLAS IF 'PUNCH' IS SPECIFIED.
*
*                 (IF ONE OF THE OPERANDS IN THE /*ROUTEX CARD IS INVALID
*                 THE JOB WILL BE KILLED DIRECTLY, BUT THIS ROUTINE WILL
*                 KEEP THE CONTROL AND APPLY THE FOLLOWING STEPS,
*                 EXCEPT THAT STEP 5 WILL BE BYPASSED).
*
*              2. GET NEXT CARD,
*                 AT END PUT CONSTANT '/*EOT NOT SUPPLIED BY USER,
*                 GENERATED BY JES2 AT PHYSICAL END-OF-FILE' INTO OUTPUT
*                 BUFFER, LOAD VALUE 4 INTO 'RL1' AND GO TO 5.
*
*              3. IF CURRENT CARD CONTAINS '/*EOT' POS. 1-5 GO TO 4.
*                 ELSE, PUT CARD INTO OUTPUT BUFFER AND GO TO 2.
*
*              4. PUT CARD INTO OUTPUT BUFFER AND LOAD VALUE 0 INTO 'RL1'.
*
*              5. QUEUE JOB TO OUTPUT QUEUE.
*
*              6. SET PSW CONDITION CODE TO 'YES' AND RETURN TO JES2.
*
*
*
*        NOTE : EXCEPT FOR THE MAIN LOGIC ROUTINE, ALL THE ROUTINES USED
*              BY THIS MOD. HAVE BEEN DUPLICATED FROM 'HASPRDR' MODULE,
*              AND FEW OF THEM HAVE BEEN MODIFIED.
*
*
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        THIS IS A MONSANTO JES2 MOD DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT
*        INITIALISATION TIME UPON REQUEST VIA AN 'EXIT=' CONTROL CARD.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*     1) JUST SUBMIT FEW ROUTEX JOBS WITH SEVERAL DESTINATIONS
*        FOR 'PRINT' AND ONE JOB FOR 'PUNCH' LOCAL.
*     2) CHECK OUTPUTS.
