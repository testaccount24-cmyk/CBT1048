***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        STANDARD JES2 PROCESSING GIVES A REMOTE NO CONFIRMATION THAT
*         HE HAS REALLY SIGNED ON.  THIS MODIFICATION SENDS THE REMOTE
*         TERMINAL A SIGNON CONFIRMATION MESSAGE, AND ALSO TRANSMITS TO
*         THE REMOTE THE STATUS OF ALL JOBS ON HIS PRINT QUEUE.
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THIS WAS MODIFICATION NUMBER 'M011' ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        AT AN APPROPRIATE POINT WITHIN REMOTE SIGN-ON PROCESSING, AFTER
*         CONTACT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED WITH THE REMOTE, EXIT WITH AN
*         UNQUALIFIED $CBAL, THUS
*               $CBAL  B303
*        WITHIN THE EXIT ITSELF, ACQUIRE A CMB, CONSTRUCT A MESSAGE OF
*         THE FORM :
*              HSPB303 REMOTE NN SIGNED ONTO LINENN
*         AND ISSUE IT VIA $WTO CMB=YES.  THEN LOCATE THE ADCT EQUIVALENT
*         TO THE REMOTES DCT AND DETERMINE IF STATUS MESSAGES ARE REQUIRED
*         ( I.E. IF THE OPTION 'LOGONQ' WAS SPECIFIED IN THE ASSOCIATED
*         'DCT' CONTROL CARD AT INITIALISATION TIME ).  IF IT WAS NOT,
*         ACQUIRE A CMB BUFFER, CREATE A COMMAND ($DN,Q=PPU)
*         TO PRINT THE STATUS OF ALL THE REMOTES PRINT JOBS.
*         ADD THIS CMB TO THE CHAIN TO BE PROCESSED BY THE COMMAND
*         PROCESSOR.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        THIS IS A MONSANTO JES2 MODIFICATION DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT
*        INITIALISATION TIME UPON REQUEST VIA AN 'EXIT=' CONTROL CARD.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        WITH THE JES2 TEST SYSTEM :-
*
*      1. SIGN-ON REMOTE13. IF THE MESSAGE 'REMOTE13 SIGNED ONTO LINENN'
*          IS DISPLAYED AND ALL JOBS QUEUED FOR R13, THE TEST IS GOOD
*          AND TERMINATED. IF NOT, SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS MOD.
*
*      2. SIGN-ON REMOTE14. SAME AS 1, BUT JOBS QUEUED FOR R14 CANNOT
*          BE DISPLAYED.
