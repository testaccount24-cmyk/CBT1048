***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THIS ROUTINE IS A SERVICE ROUTINE THAT DECHAINS A SECONDARY APCE
*         FROM THE CALLER'S PRIMARY APCE, AND ADDS IT TO A PENDING STACK
*         TO BE RETRIEVED BY ANOTHER MODIFICATION ROUTINE.
*        THE PURPOSE OF THIS ROUTINE IS TO ESTABLISH A MECHANISM WHEREBY
*         ONE MODIFICATION ROUTINE CAN PASS INFORMATION TO ANOTHER ROUTINE
*         THAT IS INDEPENDENT OF IT ( I.E. TO AN ASYNCHRONOUS ROUTINE
*         OR TO A ROUTINE THAT IS INVOKED BY A $CBAL ELSEWHERE IN JES2
*         MAIN-LINE CODE, OR TO A ROUTINE THAT IS CONTROLLED BY ONE OF OUR
*         ADDITIONAL PCE'S ).
*
*        NOTE THAT THIS ROUTINE IS RELATED TO THE SERVICE ROUTINE JES2B009,
*         WHICH RETRIEVES PASSED APCE'S FROM THE PENDING STACK UNDER THE
*         CONTROL OF THE RECEIVING TASK.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        1. DETERMINE WHETHER REG1 POINTS AT THE NAME OF THE SECONDARY APCE
*           TO BE PASSED, OR THE ( COMPLEMENTED ) ADDRESS OF THE APCE.
*        2. IF REG1 POINTS AT THE NAME, LOCATE THE APCE ADDRESS.
*        3. DECHAIN THE APCE FROM THE CALLER'S PRIMARY APCE.
*        4. ADD THE APCE TO THE TOP OF THE USER-SPECIFIED PENDING STACK
*           ( IN THE AHCT ), USING COMPARE-AND-SWAP TO ENSURE QUEUE INTEGRITY.
*        5. DETERMINE IF THE PRIMARY APCE HAS BEEN EXHAUSTED OF SECONDARY
*           APCE'S, AND IF SO SET OFF THE FLAG INDICATING SECONDARIES EXIST.
*
*        NOTE THAT REG1 MAY POINT AT THE CONSTANT 'ALL ', IN WHICH CASE
*         ALL SECONDARY APCE'S OWNED BY THE CALLER ARE DETACHED FROM THE PRIMARY
*         APCE AND ATTACHED TO THE PENDING STACK ( ONE BY ONE ).
