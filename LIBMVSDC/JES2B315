***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        WE INDUSTRIOUSLY REFORMAT SMF26 RECORDS BACK INTO THE OLD
*         HASP ACCOUNTING RECORD FORMAT, IN ORDER TO MINIMISE CONVERSION
*         PROBLEMS WITH OUR CHARGE-OUT AND PERFORMANCE-MEASUREMENT
*         SYSTEMS.  UNFORTUNATELY, WE ONLY HAVE PROVISION IN THESE RECORDS
*         FOR A 3-DIGIT JOB NUMBER.  IN ORDER TO PREVENT CONFUSION AND
*         WIDE-SPREAD CHAOS, WE WISH TO RESTRICT JES2 JOB NUMBERS TO
*         3 DIGITS ALSO.  ( IF IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR MY GRANDFATHER .... ).
*
*        THIS ALSO HAS THE BENEFIT THAT OLD ( I.E. HASP ) SYSTEM/3 SIGN-ON
*         DECKS MAY BE USED UNDER JES2 WITHOUT FALLING FACE DOWN.  ( APPARENTLY
*         THEY CANNOT HANDLE 4-DIGIT NUMBERS ).  THUS, IF WE FAIL TO GENERATE
*         ALL THE SYSTEM/3 DECKS, OR IF THEY USE THE WRONG ONE, ALL WILL STILL
*         BE HAPPINESS AND LIGHT.
*
*        ( THERE WAS NO EQUIVALENT MODIFICATION UNDER HASP ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        THIS ROUTINE IS INVOKED VIA A $CBAL IN HASPRDR ( AT STATEMENT
*         R2456200 ), AFTER JES2 HAS ASSIGNED A NEW NUMBER AND TESTED IF
*         IT EXCEEDS ITS OWN LIMIT ( OF 10000 ), RESETTING THE NUMBER TO 1
          IF THE LIMIT IS EXCEEDED.  OUR ROUTINE COMPARES THE ASSIGNED NUMBER
*         WITH OUR LIMIT ( 1000 ), AND RESETS IT TO 1 IF THE LIMIT IS
*         EXCEEDED.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        SEE JES2INST ON MVSDOC.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        SET THE JOB NUMBER TO 998 AND FEED IN TWO JOBS.
