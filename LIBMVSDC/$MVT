***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        MEMBER $MVT ON LIBRARYN.MVS CONTAINS THE MACRO '$MVT',
*         WHICH IS A MAPPING MACRO FOR THE MONSANTO VECTOR TABLE
*         ( THE CONTROL BLOCK WHICH CONTAINS THE ADDRESSES OF THE
*         COMMON AREA AND ALL THE ACCOUTING SERVICE AREAS ).
*        THE MACRO ALSO MAPS THE MVT PREFIX, WHICH, AMONG OTHER GOOD
*         STUFF, CONTAINS THE ADDRESS OF THE AUXILIARY VECTOR TABLE.
*         NOTE THAT THE AMVT DOES NOT EXIST AS YET, BUT AT SOME STAGE
*         WE WILL PROBABLY REQUIRE ONE, AND THIS TECHNIQUE ALLOWS US
*         TO ADDRESS IT ( VIA THE CVT TO THE MVT ) WITHOUT ALTERING
*         THE SHAPE OF THE ST.LOUIS CONTROL BLOCKS.
