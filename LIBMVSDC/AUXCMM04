***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THIS COMMAND DISPLAYS THE NUMBER OF PAGES IN USE BY EACH TASK,
*        THE IN AND OUT PAGING RATE FOR EACH ADDRESS SPACE AS WELL AS
*        THE OVERALL PAGING RATE FOR THE WHOLE SYSTEM.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*          THIS COMMAND OPERATES AS AN INDEPENDANT SUBTASK OF THE MASTER
*        SCHEDULER COMMUNICATIONS TASK AND IS ATTACHED BY THE AUXILIARY
*        COMMAND PROCESSOR AUXCMM01 WHEN THE PAGE OPERAND IS ENTERED
*        AS PART OF THE #D COMMAND INPUT.
*          THE ROUTINE FIRST INITIALISES ALL ITS WORKING ACCUMULATORS AND
*        SETS A TRAP IN THE REAL STORAGE MANAGER'S CONTROL BLOCK - PVT
*        SUCH THAT ALL BRANCHES TO THE PAGE IN/OUT ROUTINES WILL GO FIRST
*        TO A SUB ROUTINE OF THIS COMMAND.
*          HERE THE PAGE REQUEST IS LOGGED AND STATISTICS ARE UPDATED.
*        AT THE END OF THE SAMPLING PERIOD, (FOUR SECONDS), THE MAIN
*        ROUTINE REGAINS CONTROL, RESETS THE TRAP IN THE PVT, AND ANALYSES
*        THE FIGURES COLLECTED. THESE ARE THEN OUTPUT TO THE CONSOLE.
*          SINCE THIS COMMAND INVOLVES THE ALTERATION OF A MAJOR SYSTEM
*        CONTROL BLOCK, IT CANNOT BE TOTALLY REENTRANT AS THE OTHER
*        COMMANDS ARE. FOR THIS REASON, IF TWO OR MORE COMMANDS OF THIS
*        TYPE ARE ISSUED ONE AFTER THE OTHER, A MESSAGE IS OUTPUT TO
*        THE CONSOLE AND ALL BUT THE FIRST COMMAND ARE NOT RUN.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*          INSTALLATION OF THIS COMMAND IS BASICALLY THE SAME AS ALL THE
*        OTHERS OF THIS SERIES. BUT ONE OR TWO POINTS ARE WORTH NOTING.
*        1)    SINCE THE COMMAND IS AN INDEPENDANT ATTACHED COMMAND, IT
*              MUST BE LINK EDITTED SEPARATELY UNDER THE NAME 'AUXCMM04'
*              AND NOT AS PART OF THE AUXILIARY COMMAND ROUTINES 'AUXCOMM'
*        2)    IN ORDER TO OPERATE SUCCESSFULLY, THE COMMAND MUST NOT BE
*              SUBJECT TO PAGE FAULTS OR ADDRESSING PROBLEMS, SO IT IS BEST
*              LOADED AS PART OF THE NUCLEUS (IN EFFECT). THIS IS ACHIEVED
*              BY SIMPLY ADDING ITS NAME TO THE FIXED LPA LIST IN
*              SYS1.PARMLIB (MEMBER IEAFIXNN, WHERE NN IS AN APPROPRIATE
*              NUMBER). (BRUSSEL: NN=00)
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        THE COMMAND IS SIMPLY TESTED BY ISSUING IT UNDER DIFFERING
*        SYSTEM LOADS. IT EITHER WORKS OR IT DOESNT.
