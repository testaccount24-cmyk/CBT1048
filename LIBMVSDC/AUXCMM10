***(ABSTRACT)
*
           THIS IS THE COMMAND PROCESSOR FOR THE 'ZAP' COMMAND
*        IT IS ATTACHED DIRECTLY BY THE COMMAND PROCESSOR AUXCOMM
*        WHEN ZAP IS ENTERED THROUGH THE CONSOLE. THE COMMAND IS
*        DESIGNED AS AN INTERACTIVE DEBUGGING AND DIAGNOSTIC TOOL
*        GIVING THE USER/OPERATOR OPPORTUNITY TO STOP AN ADDRESS SPACE IN
*        ECECUTION AND EXAMINE OR MODIFY THE CONTENTS OF ITS STORAGE
*        AND CONTROL BLOCKS.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*          THE ROUTINE, BEING INTERACTIVE, IS ATTACHED AS AN INDEPENDANT
*        SUBTASK EITHER BY THE COMMUNICATIONS TASK (IF ENETERD VIA THE
*        MASTER CONSOLE) OR BY THE MONSANTO ADDRESS SPACE CONTROLLER (IF
*        ENTERED VIA THE MODIFY COMMAND).
*          IN EITHER CASE, THE PROCESSOR FIRST ESTABLISHES AN ENVIRONMENT
*        BY LOCATING THE JOB STEP TASK CONTROL BLOCK AND OUTPUTTING TO
*        THE CONSOLE THE CURRENT PSW, THE NEXT SEQUENTIAL INSTRUCTION,
*        THE NAME OF THE MODULE IN CONTROL AND THE OFFSET TO THE INSTRUCTION
*        FROM THE START OF THE PROGRAM.
*          THE OPERATOR IS THEN INVITED TO ENTER A RQUEST TO DO ONE OF THREE
*        THINGS WITH THE ADDRESS SPACE:
*        1)    DUMP IT. THE ABEND CODE WILL BE SYSTEM FFF.
*        2)    CARRY ON. RESET THE ADDRESS SPACE AND LEAVE IT ALONE
*        3)    ENTER INTERACTIVE DISPLAY MODE.
*          FOR THE THIRD CASE ABOVE, THE OPERATOR IS AGAIN INVITED TO
*        INDICATE WHAT HE WOULD LIKE DISPLAYED OR ALTERED. HE HAS A
*        CHOICE OF:
*        1)    THE CURRENT PSW.
*        2)    ANY OF THE CURRENT GENERAL PURPOSE REGISTERS.
*        3)    ANY STORAGE ADDRESSABLE FROM THIS ADDRESS SPACE.
*          THE STORAGE ADDRESSES USED FOR ITEM 3 ABOVE ARE BASED ON AN
*        INTERNAL BASE ADDRESS WHICH CAN ALSO BE SET/ALTERED/DISPLAYED
*        BY THE OPERATOR AS DESIRED.
*          THE PROGRAM CODE IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO THAT USED FOR
*        THE JES INTERACTIVE ESTAE EXIT ROUTINE 'JES2B005'.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*          THE MODULE, AS WITH AUXCMM04 AND AUXCMM06, IS LINKED AS AN
*        INDEPENDANT MODULE INTO SYS1.LINKLIB UNDER THE NAME AUXCMM10.
*        IT IS INVOKED FROM THERE BY THE COMMAND ROUTER AUXCOMM. AND
*        ATTACHED AS A SUBTASK.
*          JOB 'AUXCMM10' ON LIBRARYN.MVS WILL PERFORM THE NECCESSARY
*        COMPILE AND LINK TO INSTALL THE ROUTINE
*
***(TESTING)
*
*          THE COMMAND IS TESTED BY ENTERING 'ZAP' INTO THE CONSOLE
*        AND USING AS MANY OF THE OPERANDS AVAILABLE AS POSSIBLE.
*        THE ROUTINE INCLUDES THE INTERACTIVE ESTAE EXIT 'JES2B005'
*        AND ANY FAILURES WILL BE HANDLED BY THAT ROUTINE.(I.E. ATTEMPT
*        TO EXAMINE STORAGE NOT BELONGING TO THE CURRENT ADDRESS
*        SPACE).
