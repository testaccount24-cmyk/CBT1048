***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        ONE OF THE MAJOR CONCEPTS WITH WHICH WE HAVE STRIVED TO COMPLY
*         THROUGHOUT THE MVS CONVERSION/ENHANCEMENT PROJECT IS TO LEAVE
*         IBM CODE UNTOUCHED, AND TO 'BOLT ON' ALL OUR WONDERFUL IDEAS.
*         TO THIS END, WE DO NOT MODIFY ANY ROUTINES ON SYS1.LPALIB,
*         BUT INSTEAD COPY THE ROUTINES ELSEWHERE AND THEN MODIFY THEM.
*         THESE MODIFIED ROUTINES ARE THEM USED IN PLACE OF THE ORIGINAL
*         IBM ROUTINES THROUGH THE MAGIC OF MLPA PROCESSING.  MEMBERS
*         ON SYS1.PARMLIB WITH NAMES OF THE FORM 'IEALPAXX' DEFINE
*         MODULES THAT ARE TO BE LOADED INTO THE MODIFIED LINK PACK AREA,
*         AND SUCH MODULES FUNCTIONALLY REPLACE THE SAME MODULES ON
*         SYS1.LPALIB.
*
*        THE MANUALS STATE THAT MODULES DEFINED ON IEALPAXX MEMBERS MUST
*         BE ON SYS1.SVCLIB, SYS1.LPALIB OR SYS1.LINKLIB.  HOWEVER, WE
*         CUNNINGLY DEDUCED THAT WE COULD SPECIFY SYS1.LINKLIB WHILE
*         PLACING THE MODULES ON ANY LIBRARY DEFINED ON THE LINK-LIST.
*         TO THIS END, WE HAVE CREATED TWO NEW LIBRARIES:-
*              SYS1.MLPALIB  - CONTAINS ADDITIONS/MODIFICATIONS TO LPALIB
*              SYS1.MLPATEST - CONTAINS ADDITIONS/MODIFICATIONS UNDER TEST
*         SYS1.MLPALIB IS DEFINED ON LNKLSTM1 ( WHICH IS AUTOMATICALLY
*         CONCATENATED WITH LNKLST00 AT IPL TIME VIA IEASYS00 ), AND IS THE
*         LAST LIBRARY ON THE LINK-LIST.  ALL MODULES ON THIS LIBRARY
*         ARE DEFINED ON THE MEMBER IEALPA00, WHICH IS THE DEFAULT MLPA
*         SPECIFCIATION.
*
*        TO TEST AN ADDITION OR MODIFICATION TO LPALIB, PLACE THE MODULE
*         ON SYS1.MLPATEST, CREATE A MEMBER OF THE FORM IEALPAXX TO DEFINE
*         THE MODULE ( AND ALL ITS ALIASES ), AND RE-IPL, REPLYING
*              R 00,'SYSP=M1,LNK=(M2,00,M1),LPA=(XX,00)'
*         TO THE MESSAGE 'IEA101I SPECIFY SYSTEM PARAMETERS'.
*         THIS WILL CAUSE SYS1.MLPATEST TO BE THE FIRST LIBRARY ON THE
*         LINK-LIST ( MEMBER LNKLSTM2 DEFINES ONLY SYS1.MLPATEST ), AND
*         MODULES ON IEALPAXX ARE USED IN PREFERENCE TO MODULES ON IEALPA00
*         AR SYS1.LPALIB.  AFTER THE MODULES ARE TESTED, TRANSFER THEM TO
*         SYS1.MLPALIB, AND UPDATE IEALPA00 AS NECESSARY TO INCLUDE THE
*         MODULE(S) AND ALIAS(ES).
*
*        NOTE THAT IEALPA00 HAS DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS, AS FOLLOWS :'
*         . EVERY MODULE IS DEFINED ON A SEPARATE CARD, WITH 'SYS1.LINKLIB'
*           IN COLUMN 1, THE MODULE NAME IN COLUMN 16, AND IN COLUMN 36 A
*           REFERENCE TO THE DOCUMENTATION MEMBER THAT DESCRIBES THE NATURE
*           OF THE MODIFICATION OR ADDITION.  IF A MODULE HAS MORE THAN ONE
*           CHANGE, INCLUDE REFERENCES TO ALL NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION MEMBERS.
*         . IF THE MODULE HAS ALIASES, PLACE A COMMA (,) AFTER THE NAME
*           AND LIST THE ALIASES, SEPARATED BY COMMAS, ON AS MANY CONTINUATION
*           CARDS AS ARE NECESSARY.
* E.G.
*SYS1.LINKLIB   IEFW21SD,           SEE DOC(MNTPRVTE) AND DOC(ACCTRTN)
*               IEFAB4EC,IEFAB445,IEFAB4UV,IEFAB4F4,IEFAB4F5, ALIASES
*               IEFAB49C,IEFBB410,IEFAB4DC,IGC0009I           ALIASES
