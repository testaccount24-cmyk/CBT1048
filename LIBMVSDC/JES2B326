***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        FOR REASONS THAT DEFY THE IMAGINATION, JES2 DISTINGUISHES
*         BETWEEN JOBS HELD BY 'TYPRUN=HOLD' AND BY '/*SETUP'.  THE FORMER
*         ARE INTERPRETED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND PLACED ON THE INPUT
*         QUEUE, WHILE JOBS HELD BY '/*SETUP' ARE NOT INTERPRETED UNTIL THE
*         JOB IS RELEASED.   IF A JOB HAS BOTH /*SETUP AND TYPRUN=HOLD, A
*         RELEASE COMMAND WILL MAKE THE JOB ELIGIBLE FOR INTERPRETING, AND
*         IT WILL IMMEDIATELY BE HELD AGAIN AS THE TYPRUN=HOLD SPECIFICATION
*         IS NOTICED.  THIS LUNATIC SYSTEM PLAYS MERRY HELL WITH ANY OF OUR
*         AUTOMATED SELF-RELEASING JOB-STREAMS IN WHICH BOTH METHODS OF HOLD
*         ARE USED ON A SINGLE JOB, SINCE THE JOB-STREAM ABRUPTLY STOPS
*         SELF-RELEASING.
*        FURTHERMORE, JOBS AWAITING INTERPRETING ARE SHOWN ON QUEUE '*',
*         WHICH CONFUSES THE OPERATORS, AND CONCEALS THE TRUE STATE OF THE
*         EXECUTION QUEUES.
*
*        THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFCIATION IS TO TREAT '/*SETUP' AND
*         'TYPRUN=HOLD' IN THE SAME WAY, INTERPRETING BOTH AS SOON AS THEY
*         ENTER THE SYSTEM, THUS OBVIATING THE NEED FOR DOUBLE RELEASE
*         COMMANDS, AND INCIDENTLY IMPROVING THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO
*         THE OPERATOR AS TO THE STATE OF THE EXECUTION QUEUE.
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THERE WAS NO EQUIVALENT MODIFICATION ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        AT APPROPRIATE POINT WITHIN 'HASP INPUT SERVICE PROCESSOR'
*         IN HASPRDR MODULE, EXIT WITH AN UNQUALIFIED $CBAL, THUS :-
*
*             $CBAL JES2B326                               R5071100
*
*        IN THE EXIT ITSELF, SET ON 'JCTTHOLD' FLAG IN 'JCTJBOPT' FIELD.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        THIS MOD. IS DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT INITILISATION TIME
*         UPON REQUEST VIA AN 'EXIT=' CONTROL CARD.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        LOAD A JOB WITH AN /*SETUP CONTROL CARD. FROM ANY CONSOLE,
*         DISPLAY THIS JOB WITH AN $DJ/$DN COMMAND, IF THE TRUE JOB CLASS
*         CODE IS DISPLAYED THIS MOD. IS GOOD. IF THE CLASS CODE '*' IS
*         DISPLAYED, SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS MOD.
