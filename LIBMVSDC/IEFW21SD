***(ABSTRACT)
*
*          THIS MODIFICATION TO THE ALLOCATION ROUTINES IS DESIGNED TO
*        OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S
*        HABIT OF GIVING MOUNTABLE VOLUMES THE USE ATTRIBUTE OF PUBLIC.
*        THIS HAS THE EFFECT OF ALLOWING THE MOUNTED DISK TO BE USED FOR
*        TEMPORARY DATA SETS AND MEANS THAT IT CANNOT EASILY BE DISMOUNTED
*        IF ANOTHER JOB WANTS TO MOUNT ANOTHER VOLUME.
*          THE EFFECT OF THIS MODIFICATION IS THAT VOLUMES MOUNTED BY THE
*        SYSTEM DURING ALLOCATION ARE GIVEN THE USE ATTRIBUTE OF PRIVATE,
*        PREVENTING THEM FROM BEING USED AS WORK VOLUMES.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*          THE MODIFICATION IS IN THE FORM OF A ZAP TO THE ALLOCATION
*        ROUTINE IEFAB435 AND CHANGES AN 'OI' INSTRUCTION TO SET THE
*        PRIVATE BIT INSTEAD OF THE PUBLIC BIT IN THE UCB FOR A SPECIFIC
*        VOLUME REQUEST.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*          THE MODIFICATION IS APPLIED BY COPYING THE LOAD MODULE -
*        IEFW21SD FROM SYS1.LPALIB TO SYS1.LINKLIB, ZAPPING THE INSTRUCTION
*        WHICH IS TO BE CHANGED AND UPDATING THE PARMLIB MEMBER - IEALPA00
*        TO INCLUDE THIS UPDATED VERSION OF IEFW21SD IN THE MODIFIED LINK
*        PACK AREA AT IPL TIME.
*          A JOB TO PERFORM THE COPY AND ZAP IS ON LIBRARYN.MVS AND IS
*        CALLED IEFW21SD.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*          THE MODIFICATION IS BEING TESTED BY EXPOSURE ON THE TEST MVS
*        SYSTEM AT THE PRESENT MOMENT.
