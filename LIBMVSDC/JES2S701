***(ABSTRACT)
*
*     SUPPORT WILL BE PROVIDED FOR REMOTES THAT DO NOT SEND/RECEIVE
*              BUFFERS OF THE STANDARD &TPBFSIZ (808). ONLY BUFFERS
*              OF 808 BYTES OR LESS WILL BE RECEIVED FROM THE REMOTE.
*              JES/2 RTAM WILL BE MODIFIED TO TRANSMIT A BUFFER OF
*              400 BYTES (RATHER THAN 808) IF THE REMOTE IS SO
*              DESIGNATED.
*
*        ( THIS IS ST.LOUIS MODIFICATION NUMBER 'J701' ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*  1     HASPINIT, INITIALIZATION PARM SCAN, IS MODIFIED TO RECOGNIZE
*              A NEW PARM 'SBUF=YES' IN THE REMOTE CARD. IF YES, A BIT
*              IS SET IN THE RAT FOR THE REMOTE.
*  2     HASPRTAM, PUT ROUTINE, WILL SEARCH THE RAT FOR THE REMOTE
*              WHOSE BUFFER IS BEING BUILT. IF THE 'SHORT BUFFER' BIT
*              IS ON, THE BUFFER LIMIT WILL BE SET TO 400.
