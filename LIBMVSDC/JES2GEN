***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        IN ORDER TO EASE THE JES2 GENERATION PROCESS
*        AND INCORPORATE USER CODE MODIFICATIONS
*        THE STANDARD JES2 GENERATION PROCEDURES ARE
*        REPLACED WITH LIBRARIAN MODULES WHICH CONSTRUCT
*        THE SOURCE LIBRARY,ASSEMBLE THE MODULES AND LINK-
*        EDIT THE NEW JES2 SYSTEM.
*        IN THIS WAY NEW MODIFICATIONS ARE EASILY INCLUDED
*        BY MEANS OF LIBRARIAN -INC CARDS.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        1).   MODULE JES2GEN1 COLLECTS ALL CURRENT JES2
*        MODS BY -INC CARDS,SORTS THEM AND PASSES THEM TO
*        THE NIHDUPES PROGRAM,WHICH CHECKS FOR DUPLICATES.
*        THE MODS ARE THEN PASSED TO THE STANDARD JESIIGEN
*        PROGRAM TO CREATE A SOURCE LIBRARY.IF THIS FAILS AN ABEND
*        OCCURS TO PREVENT FURTHER RUNNING.IF IT IS OK THE
*        HASP OBJECT MODULE LIBRARY IS COMPRESSED IN ORDER
*        TO RECEIVE THE NEW VERSIONS OF THE MODULES.
*
*        2).   JES2GEN2 ASSEMBLES ALL MAJOR MODULES BY USING
*        AN -INC CARD FOR EACH SEPARATE ASSEMBLY REQUIRED.THERE
*        IS A LIBRARIAN MODULE CONTAINING THE JCL REQUIRED TO
*        ASSEMBLE EVERY JES2 MODULE.EACH ASSEMBLY STARTS WITH
*        A RELEASE STEP FOR ITSELF AND HAS TYPRUN=HOLD ON THE
*        JOBCARD;THUS IF A FAILURE OCCURRS MACHINE TIME IS NOT
*        WASTED.TO PERFORM INDIVIDUAL ASSEMBLIES THE LIBRARIAN
*        MODULE 'JOBCARD' SHOULD BE PASSED THROUGH THE INTERNAL
*        READER BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY BECAUSE OF THIS RELEASE STEP.
*        ANOTHER GROOVY FEATURE IS THAT BY PUTTING A LIBRARYN
*        -INC CARD FOR THE APPROPRIATE ASSEMBLY IN THE
*        LIBRARYN MEMBER FOR THE MODIFICATION WHICH AFFECTS
*        THE JES CODE,THE JES MEMBER WILL BE ASSEMBLED WITH
*        THE MODIFICATION CODE BY SELECTING THE 'JES2MODS'
*        MEMBER OF LIBRARYN.
*
*        4). EVERY JES2 MODIFICATION HAS FOUR LIBRARYN MODULES
*        ASSOCIATED WITH IT:THE SOURCE CODE (JES2BXXX),
*        ITS ASSEMBLY (JES2AXXX), ITS LINK-EDIT CONTROL CARDS
*        (JES2LXXX) AND A CONTROL MODULE (JES2CXXX) WHICH
*        INCLUDES THE ASSEMBLY AND LINK-EDIT MODULES.IT IS THE
*        CONTROL FILE WHICH IS INCLUDED IN A COMPLETE JES2 GENERATION.
*        TO JUST CHANGE/ASSEMBLE/LINK ONE MODULE THE SOURCE
*        LIBRARY JES2.GENLIB CAN BE UPDATED BY SYSUPDTE AND
*        THE APPROPRIATE ASSEMBLY MODULE SELECTED (WITH 'JOBCARD').
*
*        4).   MODULE JESALINK PERFORMS A LINK-EDIT OF THE
*        NEW JES2 SUB-SYSTEM INTO A TESTING LIBRARY
*        (SYS2.TESTLIB).THIS LIBRARY IS USED AS THE STEPLIB
*        IN THE JESA SECONDARY SUB-SYSTEM WHICH IS USED FOR
*        TESTING.
*
*        5). JES2MLINK PERFORMS A LINK-EDIT OF ALL MODIFICATION
*        MODULES.AGAIN EACH MODIFICATION CONTAINS ITS OWN
*        LINK-EDIT CONTROL CARDS WHICH ARE ADDED TO JES2.GENLIB
*        BY JES2GEN1 AND ARE READ BY JESMLINK.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        THE SECONDARY SUB-SYSTEM JESA IS USED FOR INITIAL
*        TESTS OF NEW JES2 SYSTEMS,USING SYS2.TESTLIB AS
*        A STEPLIB.THE INITIALISATION PARAMETERS,BOTH STANDARD
*        IBM JES2 PARAMETERS AND MONSANTO MODIFICATION
*        PARAMETERS ARE INCLUDED AS MEMBERS OF JES2.GENLIB
*        BY JES2GEN1,OR MAY BE UPDATED DIRECTLY BY THE 'SYSUPDTE'
*        PROCEDURE FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE LIBRARIAN MEMBERS.
*        THIS USE OF NESTED LIBRARIAN -INC CARDS ENSURES A
*        COMPLETE YET FLEXIBLE GENERATION AND TESTING PROCESS.
