*              RECORD COUNT AS CAPTURED IN THE SDB INTO THE PDDB
*              PDBRECCT FIELD, OVERLAYING THE ORIGINAL OUTPUT ESTIMATE.
*  2     HASPCOMM, $DF COMMAND PROCESSING, IS MODIFIED TO ISSUE AN
*              INFO LINE ON EACH WORK JOE AS ENCOUNTERED, RATHER THAN
*              JUST INCREMENTING A COUNTER BY CHAR. JOE.
*  3     HASPPRPU, OUTPUT PROCESSOR, IS MODIFIFYED TO ADD THE RECORD
*              COUNTS OF A JOB PDDB'S WHICH ARE ASSIGNED TO THE SAME
