***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        IEAVADDDM, HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS VABDUMP, IS A MUCH
*        MODIFIED VERSION OF THAT WHICH APPEARS ON THE SHARE TAPE. THE
*        MODIFICATIONS WERE NECCESSARY BECAUSE SUPERVISOR PERFORMANCE 1
*        INCLUDES A SIGNIFICANT REWRITE OF IGC005A (SNAP).
*
*        THE MODULE IS LINKED ONTO SYS1.LINKLIB. FROM WHERE IT IS
*        DYNAMICALLY INVOKED BY THE COMMON DRIVER ROUTINE XEAVAD02.
*            A JOB TO EFFECT THE ASSEMBLY OF VABDUMP AND LINK
*        IT INTO SYS1.LINKLIB AS IEAVADDM IS ON LIBRARYN-MVS
*        UNDER THE NAME IEAVADDM.
*
*        SHOULD IT BECOME NECCESSARY TO REMOVE VABDUMP FROM THE SYSTEM
*        TEMPORARILY, THEN JOB IEAVREST (ALSO ON LIBRARYN MVS) CAN BE
*        RUN. THIS RESTORES IGC0005A TO ITS ORIGINAL CONDITION.
*        (I.E. THE JOB 'DELETES' THE DRIVER XEAVAD02). BEWARE. THIS
*        ACTION WILL ALSO REMOVE ALL THE OTHER DUMP ENHANCEMENTS.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        THE PROGRAM OPERATES BY SCANNING THE DEB CHAIN FOR THE
*        ABENDING TASK. EACH DEB IS VERIFIED FOR CORRECT POINTERS AND
*        PRINTED. (ABDUMP HAS ALREADY DONE THIS ONCE. A FUTURE MOD WILL
*        REMOVE THE REPETITION OF OUTPUT). THE DEB-DCB CHAIN IS CHECKED
*        BOTH WAYS AND THE DCB IS PRINTED. EACH IOB IS FORMATTED OR,
*        IN THE CASE OF A VSAM FILE, JUST THE ACB. FINALLY THE UCB IS
*        PRINTED.
*
*        PENDING MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROGRAM ARE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE
*        PRINT LAYOUT, OMMISSION OF DEB PRINTING, ANALYSIS & PRINT OF
*        CERTAIN DCB FIELDS, CHANNEL COMMAND WORDS AND CHANNEL STATUS
*        WORDS.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        1)    ASSEMBLE THE SOURCE CODE FROM LIBRARYN-MVS  USING
*              MACLIBS - SYS1.MACLIB.
*        2)    UPDATE PARMLIB MEMBER 'IEALPA00' TO LOAD IGC0005A INTO
*              THE MODIFIED LINK PACK AREA FROM SYS1.LINKLIB
*        3)    RELINK IGC0005A FROM SYS1.LPALIB TO SYS1.LINKLIB,
*              REPLACING IEAVAD02 WITH XEAVAD02.(SEE SOURCE ITSELF)
*        4)    RE-IPL TO INCLUDE VABDUMP IN THE SYSTEM.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        ANY JOB WHICH HAS OPEN FILES & CAN BE COAXED INTO AN ABEND
*        IS SUFFICIENT TEST OF THIS MODULE.
