***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THIS COMMAND SCANS THE QCBS, AND IDENTIFIES ALL JOBS THAT ARE
*         ENQUEUED UPON THE SPECIFIED DATA SET NAME. ALTERNATIVELY, IF
*        NO DATA SET NAME IS SPECIFIED, THE COMMAND WILL SEARCH FOR ANY
*        DATA SETS WHICH HAVE JOBS WAITING FOR THEM AND REPORT ON THESE.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        THE PROGRAM IS INVOKED BY THE SECONDARY COMMAND ROUTER,
*        AUXCMM01, WHEN THE 'DD NQ,.....' COMMAND IS ENCOUNTERED. AS
*        PARAMETERS, THIS MODULE EXPECTS TO BE PASSED A CHAIN OF 1 OR
*        MORE SCAN DESCRIPTOR BLOCKS DESCRIBING THE SUBSEQUENT OPERANDS.
*          IF THE OPERAND IS A '?', THE ROUTINE INVOKES A QUERY RESPONSE
*        ROUTINE TO LIST ALL THE POSSIBLE OPERANDS AND THEIR MEANINGS.
*          IF THE OPERAND IS 'DSN=*', THE COMMAND LOACTES THE COMPLETE
*        SYSDSN QCB CHAIN, (VIA THE TESTENQ SERVICE ROUTINE), AND SCANS
*        IT FOR WAITING JOBS. ANY FOUND ARE REPORTEDON THE CONSOLE.
*          IF THE OPERAND IS A DATA SET NAME, THE ENQ CHAIN FOR THAT
*        DSNAME IS RETRIEVED, (VIA TESTENQ), AND THE STATUS OF ALL USERS
*        IS REPORTED ON THE CONSOLE.
*          ALL OUTPUT IS PERFORMED BY ISSUING THE 'LOADMSG' MACRO AS
*        OUTPUT MESSAGES ARE PREPARED AND THEN ISSUING THE 'OUTPUT' MACRO
*        TO HAVE THEM WRITTEN TO THE CONSOLE.
*          ANY ERROR CONDITIONS, - INVALID OPERANDS ETC, ARE COMMUNICATED
*        TO THE CALLER BY A RETURN CODE IN REGISTER 15.
*
***(INSTALLATION)

*          INSTALLATION OF THIS COMMAND IS ACHIEVED BY LINK-EDITTING IT
*        WITH THE REST OF THE AUXILIARYCOMMAND PROCESSORS ONTO
*        SYS1.LINKLIB AS A LOAD MODULE 'AUXCOMM'.
*          A JOB TO ASSEMBLE AUXCMM02 AND LINK IT WITH THE OTHER MODULES
*        IS ON LIBRARYN.MVS UNDER THE NAME AUXCMM02.
