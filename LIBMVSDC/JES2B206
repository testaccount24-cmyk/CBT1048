***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THE STANDARD JES2 TP LINE ERROR MESSAGE HAS A HIGH
*        PRIORITY.THUS, TO SUPPRESS THESE MESSAGES A LOT OF OTHER
*        INFORMATIVE MESSAGES MUST ALSO BE SUPPRESSED.WITH THE
*        LARGE NUMBERS OF ERRORS ENCOUNTERED ON THE EUROPEAN
*        NETWORK THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE,SO THE PRIORITY OF THIS
*        TYPE OF MESSAGE IS REDUCED.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        THIS MODIFICATION DOES NOT FULLY CONFORM TO MONSANTO
*        JES2 STANDARDS IN THAT IT IS NOT AN INITIALISATION OPTION.
*        IT IS SO SIMPLE AND SO VITAL THAT THIS IS NOT CONSIDERED
*        TO BE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE.THE MOD CONSISTS OF ONE CARD
*        WHICH REPLACES THE JES2 $WTO WITH A NEW $WTO OF LOWER
*        PRIORITY.THE MODULE AFFECTED IS HASPNUC.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        THIS MOD IS INSTALLED BY INCLUDING THE LIBRARYN MEMBER
*        JES2B206 IN THE INPUT TO THE HASPGEN PROGRAM AS IT IS
*        A STRAIGHT UPDATE TO JES2 SOURCE.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        THE MOD IS TESTED BY COMPARING THE CONSOLE OUTPUT
*        WITH THE HARDCOPY LOG OUTPUT.TP LINE ERROR MESSAGES
*        SHOULD APPEAR ON HARDCOPY BUT NOT ON THE CONSOLE.
