***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        IN ORDER TO GIVE THE COMPUTER SCHEDULERS TOTAL CONTROL OVER
*         THE RUNNING OF THE MACHINE, WE WISH THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO
*         ANYTHING THAT THEY REQUIRE VIA THE CONSOLE OF THE TERMINAL IN
*         THE COMPUTER ROOM.  TO THIS END, WE MODIFIED HASP TO ALLOW REMOTE14
*         TO DO ANYTHING THAT A LOCAL CONSOLE/READER COULD DO.  UNDER JES2,
*         WE REQUIRE THE SAME FUNCTION, BUT AS AN INITIALISATION OPTION
*         ( FOR OUR INITIALISATION PROCESSING ) OF THE FORM:-
*              DCT=REMOTE14,CONTROL=TOTAL
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THIS WAS MODIFICATION 'M092' ).
