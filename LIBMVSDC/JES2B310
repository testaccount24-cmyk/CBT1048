***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        WITH ONLY ONE LOCAL PRINTER, WE WISH TO CONTINUE TO PRINT OUR
*         JOBS IN THE OLD-FASHIONED HASP MANNER, WITH DEMAND FORMS
*         CHANGING, AND THUS PRINTING ALL OF A JOB AT ONCE.  HOWEVER,
*         JES2 - WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY WRITTEN WITH A VIEW TO PERSUADE
*         US TO BUY MORE UNIT-RECORD DEVICES - HANGS EVERY OUTPUT CLASS
*         ON A DIFFERENT OUTPUT-JOE.  TO OVERCOME THIS, THIS MODIFICATION
*         - WHICH IS WITHIN THE INTERNAL TEXT-PROCESSING EXIT - ALTERS
*         THE SYSOUT CLASS TO 'A' FOR EVERY CLASS EXCEPT THOSE DEFINED
*         TO OUR HASP SYSTEM AS BEING ELIGIBLE FOR SPECIAL-FORMS PROCESSING.
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THERE WAS NO EQUIVALENT MODIFICATION ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)

*        AT APPROPRIATE POINT IN THE HASP JCL CONVERSION ROUTINE IN

*         EVERY CLASS, EXCEPT :-
*
*              CLASSES NOT ALTERED ;
*
*               $  *  B  J  K  L  M  Z  AND T (FOR TSO HELD OUTPUT)
*
