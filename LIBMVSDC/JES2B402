***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THE FIRST TWO POSITIONAL SUBPARAMETERS OF THE ACCOUNTING DATA
*         ARE THE CHARGE CODE ( MANDATORY, 4-DIGITS ), AND THE CATEGORY
*         CODE ( MANDATORY, 1- OR 2-DIGITS ).  TO ENSURE THAT WE DO NOT
*         RUN JOBS FOR WHICH WE CANNOT CHARGE SOME-ONE, THESE FIELDS ARE
*         VALIDATED AGAINST TABLES.
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THIS WAS MODIFICATION NUMBER 'M016' ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        THIS MODULE IS PART OF THE AUXILIARY JOB CARD PROCESSOR  ( JES2B003 )
*         WHICH GAINS CONTROL AFTER JES2 HAS FINISHED WITH THE JOB CARD.
*         THE CHARGE AND CATEGORY CODES ARE VALIDATED AGAINST THE TABLES
*         ( WHICH ARE MODULE JES2B403 ), AND IF THE CODES ARE VALID, THE COND
*         CODE IN THE PSW IS SET EQUAL.  IF THE CODES ARE INVALID, THE COND CODE
*         IN THE PSW IS SET LOW SO THAT UPON RETURN TO JES2B003 IT WILL
*         RETURN A LOW COND CODE TO JES2 SO THAT CONTROL WILL BE PASSED TO
*         THE ILLEGAL JOB CARD ROUTINE.
*
*        THUS, JES2B003 IS INVOKED BY A $CBAL OF THE FORM:-
*              $CBAL  JES2B003,NO=ILLJOBCD
*
*        WITHIN JES2B003, JES2B402 IS INVOKED THUS :-
*              $MODLINK JES2B402
*              BL    JES2B003-EXIT
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THIS WAS MODIFICATION NUMBER 'M016' ).
