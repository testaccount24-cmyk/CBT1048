***(ABSTRACT)
*
*          THE RELOAD COMMAND IS DESIGNED TO FACILITATE THE TESTING OF
*        LINK PACK AREA RESIDENT MODULES WITHOUT THE NEED TO RE-IPL EACH
*        TIME THE MODULE IS UPDATED.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*          THE COMMAND PROCESSOR IS INVOKED DIRECTLY BY THE AUXILIARY
*        COMMAND ROUTER AUXCOMM WHEN THE OPERATOR ENTERES THE RELOAD COMMAND
*        THROUGH THE CONSOLE.
*          ON ENTRY THE ROUTINE INITIALISES ITS WORK AREA AND EXAMINES THE
*        NAME OF THE MODULE SUPPLIED AS AN OPERAND OF THE COMMAND.
*        THE QUEUE OF ACTIVE CDE'S REPRESENTING THE ACTIVE LINK PACK AREA
*        IS FIRST EXAMINED FOR A MODULE OF THE SAME NAME AND A REPORT OUTPUT
*        TO THE CONSOLE STATING WHETHER THE MODULE WAS FOUND OR NOT.
*          IF NOT, THEN THE NON-ACTIVE LINK PACK AREA DIRECTORY, (THE
*        CHAIN OF LPDE'S) IS SIMILARILY EXAMINED. IF NO TRACE OF THE MODULE
*        IS FOUND, A SUITABLE MESSAGE IS OUTPUT.
*          IF THE MODULE IS FOUND, THE PROGRAM LOADER - IEWFETCH IS
*        INVOKED TO LOAD THE MODULE AFRESH INTO THE COMMON AREA. THE ADDRESS
*        OF THE NEW EXTENT LIST IS STORED IN THE CDE AND THE ENTRY POINT
*        UPDATED TO REFLECT THE NEW POSITION OF THE MODULE. THE OLD EXTENTS
*        ARE FREEMAINED.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*          THE MODULE IS INSTALLED BY LINK EDITTING IT WITH THE REST OF THE
*        AUXILIARY COMMAND PROCESSOR AS MODULE 'AUXCOMM' ON SYS1.LINKLIB.
*        A COMPLETE JOB TO DO THIS IS ON LIBRARYN.MVS AND IS CALLED
*        'AUXCMM09'.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*          THE MODULE IS CURRENTLY BEING TESTED IN THE INSTALLATION OF
*        JES2 AND THE ACCOUNTING ROUTINES.
