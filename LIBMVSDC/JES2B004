***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THIS MODULE IS ENTERED VIA A PSEUDO 'CALL' FROM
*        JES2B001,THE MODS INITIALISATION PROCESSOR.
*        IT ATTEMPTS TO LOAD A SPECIFIED MODIFICATION MODULE
*        AND UPDATE THE AHCT MRCB FIELDS FOR THAT MODULE.
*        IF 'INIT' HAS BEEN REQUESTED CONTROL IS PASSED
*        TO THE MODULE BEFORE RETURNING TO JES2B001.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        THE PROGRAM USES THE '$RTIN' MACRO TO ESTABLISH
*        NORMAL O/S SAVE AREA CHAINING,TO DEFINE THE
*        STANDARD JES2 AND MONSANTO CONTROL BLOCKS AND
*        TO DESCRIBE THE PARAMETERS PASSED BY JES2B001.
*
*        ONCE IT HAS SORTED OUT THE NAME OF THE MODULE
*        REQUIRED IT ISSUES A BLDL REQUEST TO VERIFY THE
*        EXISTENCE OF THE MODULE THEN ISSUES A 'LOAD' FOR IT.
*        THE MRCB FOR THE MODULE IS UPDATED AND THE FLAGS
*        IN THE CONTROL CARD RECORD SAVE AREA EXAMINED FOR
*        THE 'INIT' OPTION.IF THIS IS PRESENT CONTROL IS
*        PASSED TO THE MODULE VIA A BALR INSTRUCTION,
*        PASSING ALONG THE ORIGINAL JES2B001 PARAMETER LIST.
*        UPON RETURN FROM THE INITIALISATION PROCESSING
*        THE MODULE WILL RETURN IN REGISTER 15 A RETURN CODE IN
*        THE HIGH ORDER BYTE AND THE THREE BYTE ADDRESS OF THE
*        PROCESSING ROUTINES TO BE INVOKED BY $CBAL'S FROM JES2.
*        JES2B004 WILL THEN SUSTITUTE THIS ADDRESS FOR THE DEFAULT
*        ENTRY POINT ADDRESS IN THE APPROPRIATE MRCB FIELD OF THE AHCT
*
*        UPON COMPLETION CONTROL RETURNS TO JES2B001 WITH
*        A RETURN CODE INDICATING THE STATUS OF THE MODULE.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        THIS MODULE IS INCLUDED IN THE JES2B001 LOAD MODULE BY
*        THE LINKAGE EDITOR,EITHER BY 'INCLUDE' CONTROL CARDS OR BY
*        AUTOMATIC CALL LIBRARY PROCESSING OF A WXTRN STATEMENT
*        SPECIFYING THIS MODULE IN JES2B001.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        SEE JES2B001.
