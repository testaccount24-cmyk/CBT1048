***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THE PURPOSE OF THIS ROUTINE IS TO ISSUE ALL WTOS GENERATED
*         BY THE VARIOUS ROUTINES INVOKED BY THE AUXILIARY COMMAND ROUTER.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        WHEN THE ROUTINE RECEIVES CONTROL, REGISTER
*         1 POINTS AT THE START OF A CHAIN OF MESSAGES.  THIS ROUTINE
*         ISSUES EACH MESSAGE AS A WTO.  WHEN IT HAS PROCESSED ALL THE
*         MESSAGES, IT FREEMAINS THE MESSAGE ELEMENTS AND RETURNS VIA R14.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        INSTALLATION IS BY ASSEMBLING AND LINKLING THE MODULE AS PART
*        OF AUXCOMM ON SYS1.LINKLIB. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY RUNNING THE
*        JOB 'AUXCMM00' ON LIBRARYN.MVS.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        OPERATION OF THIS MODULE IS VERIFIED BY EACH EXECUTION OF ONE
*        OF THE AUXILIARY COMMANDS
