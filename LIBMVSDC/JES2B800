***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        TO REPLACE THE 'GIMME' FACILITIES THAT WE DEVELOPED UNDER HASP,
*         WE ACQUIRED AN FDP ( SEE MODULE 'GIMME' FOR DETAILS ) WHICH
*         UNLOADS JOBS FROM SPOOL TO TAPE IN SUCH A FORM THAT THEY MAY BE
*         RELOADED TO THE SYSTEM.  THIS FDP WAS INTENDED PRIMARILY AS A
*         CONVERSION AID FOR MOVING FROM HASP TO JES2, AND THE BASIC
*         PACKAGE FALLS SHORT OF OUR REQUIREMENTS.
*        ONE OF THE MORE FUNDAMENTAL SHORTCOMINGS IS THAT WHILE YOU UNLOAD
*         A PRINT DATA SET, YOU RELOAD AN IEBGENER JOB WHICH MUST BE RUN
*         TO RECREATE THE PRINT DATA SET.  SINCE THE USUAL TIME THAT WE
*         USE THIS FACILITY IS AT MONTH-END, THE LAST THING WE WANT IS TO
*         DO IS TO CREATE MORE JOBS TO RUN.
*
*        THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO OBVIATE THE NECESSITY
*         OF CREATING AND RUNNING THESE IEBGENER JOBS.  THE SPOOL TRANSFER
*         PROGRAM HAS BEEN MODIFIED SO THAT, BY DEFAULT, IT WILL NOT CREATE
*         AN IEBGENER JOB, BUT WILL INSTEAD CREATE A 'JOB' COMPRISING A
*         JOB CARD, A /*GIMMEX CARD AND THE DATA FOR THE PRINT LINES ( WITH
*         EACH LINE ON TWO PSEUDO CARD-IMAGES ).  THIS MODIFICATION
*         RECOGNISES THE /*GIMMEX CARD, RE-CONSTITUTES THE PRINT DATA SET
*         FROM THE CARD IMAGES AND QUEUES THE 'JOB' FOR OUTPUT.
*
*        THE /*GIMMEX CONTROL CARD CONTAINS THE LRECL OF THE ORIGINAL
*         PRINT RECORDS, THE DESTINATION NAME, THE CLASS AND FORMS TYPE
*         OF THE ORIGINAL OUTPUT DATA SET, AND THE ORIGINAL JOB NUMBER.
*         THE FORMAT OF THE CONTROL CARD IS :-
*              /*GIMMEX  LLLLL REMOTENN SYSOUT=(X,,FORM) JOBNO=NNNN
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THERE WAS NO EQUIVALENT MODIFICATION ).
*
*       /*GIMMEX CONTROL CARD FORMAT :-
*        0        1         2         3         4         5         6
*        123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
*
*        /*GIMMEX LLLLL REMOTENN       SYSOUT=A
*        /*GIMMEX LLLLL LOCAL          SYSOUT=(A,,1612)
*                   *      *                  *
*                   *      *                  ****> NORMAL 'SYSOUT' PARMS
*                   *      ****> DESTINATION
*                   ****> RECORD LENGTH (CARRIAGE CONTROL CHAR. INCLUDED)
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        SAME AS /*ROUTEX (JES2B903), BUT BETWEEN /*GIMMEX AND /*EOT
*         THIS MOD READS 2 INPUT RECORDS FOR 1 LINE TO BE PRINTED.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        THIS IS A MONSANTO MODIFICATION DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT
*        INITIALISATION TIME UPON REQUEST VIA AN 'EXIT=' CONTROL CARD
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        TO TEST :-
*
*         SUBMIT AND EXECUTE THE JOB 'TESTB800' WITH THE JES2 TEST SYSTEM.
*
*         YOU WILL FIND THIS JOB IN 'LIBRARYN.MVS' DATA SET,
*           MEMBER 'TESTB800', PASSWORD 'T800'.
*
*
*        RESULT TO BE OBTAINED :-
*
*          1) OUTPUT MUST BE QUEUED TO REMOTE14, IN 'SYSOUT' CLASS 'M'
*              AND FORM '1612'.
*
*          2) CHECK IF PRINTED REPORT LOOK NORMAL (POSITION 132 MUST
*              BE USED FOR PAGE NUMBER).
