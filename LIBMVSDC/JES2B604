***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        AUGMENT THE $D'JOBNAME' COMMAND TO ALLOW JOBS TO BE DISPLAYED
*         BY 'ROOT' NAME.  WITH THIS MODIFICATION, IF THE COMMAND IS
*              $D'AAA*
*         THEN ALL JOBS WHOSE NAME STARTS WITH THE CHARACTER STRING 'AAA'
*         WILL BE DISPLAYED.  THE CHARACTER STRING 'AAA' MAY BE FROM 1 TO 7
*         CHARACTERS IN LENGTH.
*
*         DURING THE TESTS THIS MOD HAS BEEN IMPROVED.
*         $D'*ABC' - IF THE FIRST CHARACTER OF THE CHARACTER STRING
*                    IS AN ASTERISK, ALL JOBS WITH THE STRING 'ABC'
*                    ANYWHERE IN THE JOBNAME WILL BE DISPLAYED.
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THIS WAS MODIFICATION NUMBER 'M090' ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        WITHIN THE AUXILIARY COMMAND PROCESSOR ( SEE JES2B002 ), INTERCEPT
*         COMMANDS OF THE FORM ''$D'AAA'' AND DETERMINE IF THE LAST CHARACTER
*         OF THE CHARACTER STRING IS AN ASTERISK.  IF THE LAST CHARACTER IS
*         NOT AN ASTERISK, SET THE COND CODE IN THE PSW TO LOW AND
*         RETURN TO JES2 TO ALLOW THE STANDARD COMMAND PROCESSOR TO PROCESS
*         THE COMMAND.  IF THE LAST CHARACTER IS AN ASTERISK, THEN SCAN
*         THE JOB QUEUE FOR EVERY JOB WITH THE 'ROOT' NAME 'AAA' AND ISSUE
*         A STATUS MESSAGE OF THE FORM
*              HSPB604 AAAAAAAA ............
*         WHEN ALL APPROPRIATE JOBS HAVE BEEN PROCESSED, RETURN CONTROL
*         WITH THE COND CODE IN THE PSW SET TO EQUALITY SO THAT STANDARD
*         JES2 PROCESSING WILL BE BYPASSED.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        THIS IS A MONSANTO JES2 MOD DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT
*        INITIALISATION TIME UPON REQUEST VIA AN 'EXIT=' CONTROL CARD.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        ENTER  $D'...*'  AND  $D'*...'  COMMANDS, BY USING
*         ANY JOBS IN Q DURING THIS TEST.
