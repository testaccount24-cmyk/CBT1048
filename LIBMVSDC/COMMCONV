***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THE AUXILIARY COMMANDS INVOKED BY THE AUXILIARY COMMAND ROUTER
*         ( SEE AUXCOMM ) ALL COMPLY WITH THE FOLLOWING CONVENTIONS:-
*              1. EVERY COMMAND IS WITHIN A SEPARATE PROCESSING ROUTINE
*              2. IF THE LAST OPERAND SUPPLIED TO A COMMAND IS '?', THEN
*                 THE COMMAND ISSUES A SERIES OF WTOS TO EXPLAIN ITS
*                 FUNCTION(S) AND ITS OPERAND(S).
*              3. ALL MODULES PASS CONTROL TO OTHERS VIA A PSEUDO XCTL,
*                 PRESERVING THE NAME OF THE DESTINATION ROUTINE IN A FIELD
*                 AND BRANCHING TO THE ROUTINE AFTER PLACING THE ADDRESS
*                 INTO R15 FROM A V-TYPE ADCON.
*                 ( THIS IMPLIOES, OF COURSE, THAT ALL THE ROUTINES ARE
*                 LINK EDITED TOGETHER, SO THAT THERE IS NO EXECUTION TIME
*                 OVERHEAD TO RETRIEVE USABLE VERSIONS OF THE ROUTINES ).
*              4. ALL WTO I/O IS PERFORMED BY ROUTINE 'AUXCMM00'.  ALL
*                 OTHER ROUTINES BUILD UP A QUEUE OF MESSAGES IN CORE, AND
*                 XCTL TO AUXCMM00 AT TERMINATION TO ISSUE THE MESSAGES.
*              5. ALL MESSAGES PRODUCED BY AN AUXILIARY COMMAND PROCESSOR
*                 ARE PRECEDED BY THE NAME OF THE ROUTINE PRODUCING THEM.
