***(ABSTRACT)
*
*              COBOL/VS IS INSTALLED WITH ALL THE GENERATION DEFAULTS
*        IN EFFECT.
*              THIS MEANS THAT A NON-REENTRANT COMPILER HAS BEEN GENERATED
*        SO THAT IT MAY BE RETROFITTED TO MFT. THEN HOPEFULLY THERE
*        WILL BE NO PROBLEM WHEN THE USERS MIGRATE TO MVS.
*              ALL MODULES ARE ON THE SAME LIBRARY 'SYS1.COBVS11' WHICH IS
*        ON LNKLST00. NOTE THE RELEASE LEVEL IN THE DSNAME.
*              THE PROCEDURES SUPPLIED WITH THE PACKAGE HAVE BEEN DISCARDED
*        AND THE CURRENT ONES MODIFIED AS FOLLOWS:-
*              1. LIB1 PARAMETER NOW DEFAULTS TO 'SYS1.COBVS11'
*              2. COMPILER LISTING OPTIONS ARE 'DMAP,CLIST,SXREF,SUPMAP'.
*              3. SYMBOLIC PARAMETERS 'COPT= LOPT='  HAVE BEEN
*                 ADDED TO FACILITATE THE ADDING OR COUNTERMANDING
*                 THE COMPILER AND LINKED. DEFAULT OPTIONS.
*              4. SYMBOLIC PARAMETER 'GOPARM=' HAS BEEN ADDED TO PROCS
*                 WITH GO STEPS TO ALLOW PARMS TO BE PASSED EASILY.

***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*              ***** NOT APPLICABLE *****
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*              ALL MODULES REFFERED TO ARE ON LIBRARYN.MVS.
*        1. THE INSTALLATION JOBSTREAM SUPPLIED AS FILE 1 OF THE
*           DISTRIBUTION TAPE HAS BEEN LOADED TO LIBRARYN AS MODULE
*           'COBVS' USING MODULE 'COBVLOAD'.
*        2. MODULE 'COBVSMOD' WAS USED TO DO A TEMPORARY UPDATE ON 'COBVS'
*           AND PUT THE RESULTING JOBSTREAM ON THE INTERNAL READER.
*           FOR A NEW RELEASE OF COB/VS IT WILL ONLY BE NECCESSARY TO
*           MODIFY THE RELEASE NO. AND THE SEQUENCE NOS. IN THIS MODULE.
*        3. THE GENERATED JOBSTREAM INSTALLS THE COMPILER AND LIBRARY.
*        4. PTF TAPE-6 HAS BEEN INSTALLED IN A SIMILAR FASHION OVER
*           THE BASIC INSTALLATION.
*              - 'COBVPTFL' LOADS 'COBVSPTF' TO LIBRARYN.
*              - 'COBVPTFM' DOES TEMP MODIFY AND PUTS J/S ON INTRDR.
*              - MODIFIED 'COBVSPTF' INSTALLS PTF TAPE-6.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*              IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TEST A COMPILER SATISFACTORILY
*        BUT THE FOLLOWING TESTS WERE RUN.
*              1. THE TWO COMPILES IN THE INSTALLATION J/S RAN
*                 TO GOOD END.
*              2. A MOPP PROGRAM WITH AN INTERNAL SORT, THAT GAVE
*                 PROBLEMS WITH COBOL ANS V3R2, COMPILED AND EXECUTED OK.
*                 THIS TEST RAN ON MVS, WHERE THE COMPILER WAS ORIGIONALLY
*                 INSTALLED AND ON AN MFT SYSTEM TO WHICH IT WAS COPIED.
