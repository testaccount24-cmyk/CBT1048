***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THIS ROUTINE IS A SERVICE ROUTINE TO PERFORM $WTO'S
*        FOR MONSANTO COMMAND PROCESSORS IN THE SAME MANNER AS JES2
*        MODULE HASPCOMM ROUTINE CWTO.INDEED MOST OF THE CODE IS
*        COPIED DIRECTLY FROM THE CWTO ROUTINE.
*
*        THIS SERVICE ROUTINE IS ENTERED FROM COMMAND PROCESSORS
*        BY MEANS OF THE $MWTO (MONSANTO $CWTO) MACRO.THIS HAS THE
*        SAME SYNTAX AS $CWTO TO EASE CONVERSION OF OTHER PEOPLES'
*        JES MODS INTO OUR FORMAT (OR VICE-VERSA) AND AGAIN MUCH OF
*        THE CODE IS 'LIFTED' FROM JES,EXCEPT THAT THE VARIOUS FUNCTION
*        ENTRY POINTS ARE RESOLVED INTO A VALUE IN REGISTER 15 WHICH
*        IS USED IN JES2B013 AS AN INDEX INTO A BRANCH LIST.
*        THE JES2 ACE PROCESSING ASSOCIATED WITH THE CWTO ROUTINE
*        IS NOT REPEATED ON THE BASIS THAT IT WILL BE PERFORMED
*        BY JES AT THE END OF THE COMMAND PROCESSING.
*
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*              SEE THE JES2 LOGIC MANUAL DEALING WITH $CWTO
*              AND THE CWTO PROCESSING ROUTINES.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        THIS MOD. IS DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT INITILISATION TIME
*         UPON REQUEST VIA AN 'EXIT=' CONTROL CARD.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        THIS MOD. CAN BE CONSIDERED AS GOOD, IF ALL THE OTHER
*         MODS USING IT ARE WORKING SUCCESSFULLY.
