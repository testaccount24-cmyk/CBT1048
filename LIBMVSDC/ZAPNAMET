***(ABSTRACT)
*
*              MONSANTO HAVE BEEN USING 3330 MOD-11 WITH AN MFT SYSTEM.
*        TO DO THIS AN IBM FDP WAS APPLIED.
*        UNFORTUNATELY THE FDP DOES NOT ALTER THE SINGLE DENSITY DEVICE
*        CODE OF '30502009' PUT INTO THE ENTRY   WHEN A DATASET IS
*        CATALOGED.
*              WHEN CONVERTING TO MVS IT IS DESIRABLE TO BE ABLE TO
*        ACCESS THE OLD MFT CATALOG ENTRIES USING MFT OR MVS, BUT THE
*        CODE '30502009' CANNOT BE GENERATED TO REPRESENT DOUBLE DENSITY
*        3330'S.
*              TO ENABLE THE CATALOG ACCESS, A ZAP HAS BEEN DEVELOPED
*        THAT UTILISES A SPARE SLOT IN THE DEVICE NAME TABLES FOR 3330-1.
*        THIS SLOT WAS GENERATED WITH THE NAME 'SPRDISK'.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*              ZAP DEVNAMET DEVMASKT AND EDTTAB AT THE POINT WHERE
*        THE NAME 'SPRDISK' IS GENERATED, INSERTING THE CODE '30502009'
*        TO REPRESENT DOUBLE DENSITY 3330'S. THIS IS THE CODE FOR
*        SINGLE DENSITY 3330'S, BUT NONE ARE USED AT MONSANTO BXL.
*        MFT FDP FOR 3330-1 DOES NOT CHANGE THE DEVICE CODE.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        1. MEMBER 'ZAPNAMET' ON LIBRARYN.MVS INSTALS THIS MOD.
*        2. MEMBER 'ZAPNAMER' BACKS IT OUT IF NECESSARY.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        1. FIND AN ENTRY IN AN MFT MAINTAINED CATALOG WITH A DEVICE
*              CODE OF '30502009'. RUN A JOB THAT DEFINES THE DATSET
*              AS OLD. IF THERE IS NO JCL ERROR, THE MOD HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL
*        2. THE MEMBER LOOK3330 ON LIBRARYN.MVS WAS USED AT INITIAL INST.
