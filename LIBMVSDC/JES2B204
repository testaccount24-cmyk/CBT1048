***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        TO REDUCE OPERATOR INTERVENTION WHEN RUNNING WITH DEMAND
*         MOUNTING - OUR PREFERRED WAY OF OPERATING AT THE MOMENT - WE
*         WISH MOUNT COMMANDS FOR STANDARD FORMS TO BE BYPASSED WITHIN
*         A JOB IF THE STATIONERY CURRENTLY MOUNTED IS OF THE SAME SIZE
*         AS STANDARD PAPER ( THIS CAN BE DETERMINED FROM THE FORMS TYPE
*         THANKS TO OUR INSPIRED USE OF A STANDARD CODE STRUCTURE ).
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THIS WAS MODIFICATION NUMBER 'M005' ).
