***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THIS MODIFICATION IS NOT AN EXECUTABLE ROUTINE, BUT IS A TABLE
*         OF VALID CHARGE CODES.  IT IS ACCESSED BY JES2B402 TO DETERMINE
*         IF A JOB'S CHARGE CODE IS VALID, AND IS MAINTAINED BY A PROGRAM
*         IN PROCEDURE 'COST05' WHICH UPDATES THE PROJECT LOG.  NOTE THAT
*         THIS IMPLEMENTATION DIFFERS FROM THAT UNDER HASP IN THAT A NEWLY
*         OPENED CHARGE CODE WILL NOT BE VALID TO JES2 UNTIL THE NEXT TIME
*         JES2 IS INITIALISED, WHILE UNDER HASP THE TABLE WAS ON THE OVERLAY
*         LIBRARY, AND WAS IMMEDIATELY EFFECTIVE.
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THIS WAS PART OF MODIFICATION NUMBER 'M016' ).
