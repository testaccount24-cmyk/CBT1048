***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        TO REPLACE THE 'GIMME' FACILITIES THAT WE DEVELOPED UNDER HASP,
*         WE ACQUIRED AN FDP ( SEE MODULE 'GIMME' FOR DETAILS ) WHICH
*         UNLOADS JOBS FROM SPOOL TO TAPE IN SUCH A FORM THAT THEY MAY BE
*         RELOADED TO THE SYSTEM.  THIS FDP WAS INTENDED PRIMARILY AS A
*         CONVERSION AID FOR MOVING FROM HASP TO JES2, AND THE BASIC
*         PACKAGE FALLS SHORT OF OUR REQUIREMENTS.
*        AMONG THE THINGS THAT THE SPOOL TRANSFER PACKAGE DOES NOT DO IS
*         TO AUTOMATICALLY KEEP TRACK OF THE WHEREABOUTS OF UNLOADED JOBS.
*         WE DO NOT WANT TO ENCUMBER THE OPERATORS WITH ANY MORE MANUALLY-
*         MAINTAINED DOCUMENTS THAN ARE STRICTLY NECESSARY, AND CONSEQUENTLY
*         WE WANT JES2 TO KEEP TRACK OF ALL UNLOADED JOBS.  NOTE THAT THIS
*         ALSO MAKES THINGS CLEARER FOR THE REMOTE OPERATORS SINCE THEY CAN
*         THEN LOCATE THEIR JOBS VIA THE NORMAL JES2 COMMANDS.
*
*        THE BASIC SPOOL TRANSFER PACKAGE ISSUES $P COMMANDS TO THE INTERNAL
*         READER TO PURGE JOBS AS IT UNLOADS THEM.  WE HAVE MODIFIED THE
*         SPOOL TRANSFER PROGRAM SO THAT INSTEAD OF $P COMMANDS IT WILL
*         GENERATE A COMMAND OF THE FORM :-
*              $G JNNN,TAPE=GIMEXX
*         WHERE 'NNN' IS THE JOB NUMBER, AND 'GIMEXX' IS THE VOLUME SERIAL
*         NUMBER OF THE TAPE TO WHICH THE JOB HAS BEEN UNLOADED.
*
*        THIS MODIFICATION IS AN AUXILIARY COMMAND WHICH PROCESSES THE $G
*         COMMAND, PERFORMING THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS :-
*              .INSERT THE VOLSER INTO THE FIELD AJQEGIME IN THE JQE
*              .SET THE AUXILIARY HOLD FLAG 'AJQFGIME' ( USING THE MACRO
*               $AUXFLAG, WHICH ALSO SETS AJQFPHLD AND JQEHOLD1 ).
*              .FREE ALL SPOOL TRACKS USED BY THE JOB
*              .ISSUE A MESSAGE TO THE OPERATOR TO CONFIRM THAT THE
*               JOB HAS BEEN UNLOADED
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THERE WAS NO EQUIVALENT MODIFICATION ).
