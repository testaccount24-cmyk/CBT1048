***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THE OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT USE THE PROGRAMMER NAME FIELD OF THE
*         JOB CARD TO SPECIFY THE DISTRIBUTION ( I.E. DESTINATION ) OF
*         THE REPORTS.  THIS MODIFICATION FORMATS THE LINES OF THE SEPARATOR
*         PAGE TO INCLUDE THE PROGRAMMER NAME FIELD, AND TO DISTINGUISH
*         BETWEEN TESTING AND PRODUCTION JOBS ( FROM THE CATEGORY CODE ).
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THIS WAS MODIFICATION NUMBER 'M002' ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        WITHIN JES2, AFTER THE FIRST HALF OF THE SEPARATOR PAGE HAS BEEN
*         PRODUCED ( WITH THE JOB NAME IN BLOCK LETTERS ), EXIT WITH
*         A $CBAL INSTRUCTION OF THE FORM :-
*              $CBAL  B301,YES=ADDR
*         WHERE 'ADDR' IS THE ADDRESS OF THE INSTRUCTION FOLLOWING THE JES2
*         CODE THAT FORMATS THE REPETITIVE LINE.
*        WITHIN THE EXIT ITSELF, FORMAT THE PRINT LINE, INCLUDING THE
*         PROGRAMMER NAME FIELD AND THE NATURE OF THE JOB.  BEFORE RETURNING
*         TO JES2, SET THE COND CODE IN THE PSW TO EQUALITY, SO THAT
*         THE JES2 CODE FORMATTING THE LINE WILL BE BYPASSED.
*
*        ( THE PROGRAMMER NAME FIELD AND THE CATEGORY CODE ARE IN THE JCT ).
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        THIS MOD. IS DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT INITILISATION TIME
*         UPON REQUEST VIA AN 'EXIT=' CONTROL CARD.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*
*        TO TEST :-
*
*         SUBMIT AND EXECUTE THE JOBS 'TESTB301' WITH THE
*          JES2 TEST SYSTEM.
*
*           YOU WILL FIND THESE JOBS IN 'LIBRARYN.MVS' DATA SET,
*            MEMBER NAME 'TESTB301', PASSWORD 'T301'.
*
*        RESULT TO BE OBTAINED :-
*
*         COMPARE THE FIRST AND LAST SEPARATOR PAGES WITH INFORMATION
*          SUPPLIED IN PGMR NAME AREA OF THE JOB CARD.
*
*         IF IDENTICAL FOR ALL THE 'B301' JOBS, TEST GOOD AND TERMINATED.
*         IF NOT IDENTICAL, SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS MOD.
