***(ABSTRACT)
*
*            THIS ROUTINE IS PART OF THE MONSANTO DUMP MODIFICATIONS
*        AND IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE OPERATORS FROM 'MISSING' AN ABEND
*        IN A PRODUCTION JOB. HE MUST RESPOND WITH HIS INITIALS AND A BRIEF
*        DESCRIPTION OF HIS INTENTIONS BEFORE THE JOB IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE
*        IN ABNORMAL TERMINATION.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*            THIS ROUTINE IS INVOKED AUTOMATICALLY BY THE MONSANTO DUMP
*        MODIFICATION CONTROLLER WHENEVER AN ABEND OCCURS IN A JOB STEP
*        WHICH INCLUDES A SYSUDUMP OR SYSABEND DD STATEMENT.
*            THE ROUTINE TESTS THE JCL ACCOUTING FIELD ON THE JOB CARD TO
*        SEE IF THIS IS A PRODUCTION JOB. (FROM THE CATEGORY CODE).
*        IF IT IS, A MESSAGE IS WRITTEN TO THE OPERATOR TO INFORM HIM OF
*        THE NAME OF THE JOB, THE NAME OF THE STEP AND THE ABEND CODE. HE
*        MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THIS BY ENTERING HIS INITIALS. A SUBSEQUENT MESSAGE
*        IS ISSUED INVITING HIM TO REPORT HIS INTENDED COURSE OF ACTION AS
*        A RESULT OF THE ABEND. BOTH RESPONSES TO THE ABOVE MESSAGES ARE
*        OUTPUT IN THE DUMP LISTING TO ASSIST WHOEVER RECEIVES THE RESULTING
*        ABEND IN DETERMINING THE SOURCE OF THE ERROR.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*            THE ROUTINE IS INVOKED DYNAMICALLY BY 'JEAVAD02' EVERY TIME
*        AN ABEND OCCURS IN A JOB STEP WHICH INCLUDES A SYSUDUMP OS SYSABEND
*        DD STATEMENT. IT MUST BE LINK EDITTED ONTO 'SYS1.MLPALIB' ALONG WITH
*        THE OTHER DUMP MODIFICATION ROUTINES AND HAVE AN ENTRY POINT NAME OF
*        'IEAVADZZ'.
