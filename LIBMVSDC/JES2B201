***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        IN ORDER TO MINIMISE TURNAROUND AND MAXIMISE THROUGHPUT OF OUR
*         LOCAL 'REMOTE' TERMINALS, WE AUTOMATICALLY REROUTE JOBS TO THE
*         FAST LOACL PRINTER IF THEY EXCEED A SPECIFIED SIZE.  TO MAKE
*         THIS MODIFICATION AS OPEN ENDED AS POSSIBLE, PROCESSING IS
*         TRIGGERED AT THE DCT LEVEL AND CONTROLLED BY AN INITIALISATION
*         CONTROL CARD ( ONE OF OURS, NOT THE BASIC JES2 CONTROL CARDS ).
*
*        THE CONTROL CARD IS OF THE FORM :-
*              DCT=REMOTE13,REROUTE=(NNNNN,DEST)
*         WHERE NNNNN IS THE SIZE OF OUTPUT THAT WILL CAUSE REROUTING,
*         AND DEST IS THE NAME OF THE LOCATION TO WHICH TO REROUTE THE
*         PRINT OUTPUT.
*        E.G.  DCT=REMOTE13,REROUTE=(10000,LOCAL)
*              DCT=REMOTE18,REROUTE=(5000,REMOTE1)
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THIS WAS MODIFICATION NUMBER 'M010' ).
