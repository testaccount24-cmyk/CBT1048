***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THE BASIC JES2 REPONSE TO THE $DJ COMMAND CONCEALS INFORMATION
*         THAT WE ARE USED TO RECEIVING WITH OUR SUPERIOR HASP SYSTEM, AND
*         DOES NOT ALLOW FOR SUCH FEATURES AS 'ON TAPE', 'KEEP', AND 'UHOLD'.
*         THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO IMPROVE THE OUTPUT TO A
*         $DJ COMMAND BY EMBODYING ALL SUCH ADDITONAL INFORMATION.
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THIS WAS A MODIFICATION WITHOUT A NUMBER ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        THIS MODIFICATION IS INVOKED BY AN UNQUALIFIED $CBAL IN THE
*         SERVICE ROUTINE THAT ASSEMBLES A RESPONSE TO $DJ COMMANDS, AFTER
*         THE BASIC JES2 REPONSE HAS BEEN ASSEMBLED, AND BEFORE THE RESPONSE
*         HAS BEEN ISSUED.
*
*        OUR RESPONSE INCLUDES SUCH INFORMATION AS :-
*              . 'SOFT'            - JOB IN SOFT HOLD STATUS
*              . 'KEEP'            - JOB HAS BEEN KEPT BY LOCAL OPERATOR
*              . 'ON TAPE GIMEXX'  - JOB HAS BEEN UNLOADED TO GIMME TAPE
*              . 'UHOLD'           - JOB IN USER HOLD STATUS
*              . 'ZZZZ'            - JOB IS AWAITING PRINT ON FORMS 'ZZZZ'
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        THIS IS A MONSANTO JES2 MOD DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT
*        INITIALISATION TIME UPON REQUEST VIA AN 'EXIT=' CONTROL CARD.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        ENTER SEVERAL $DJ AND $DN COMMANDS FROM ANY CONSOLE,
*         AND CHECK IF INFORMATION DISPLAYED CORRESPONDS
*         TO THE REALITY. REALITY THAT YOU CAN MODIFY WITH
*         OTHER COMMANDS TO DO A BETTER TEST ($AA,$HA,$HJ,$AJ,ETC...).
