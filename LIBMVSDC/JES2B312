***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        TO OBVIATE THE POSSIBILITY OF ACCIDENTLY LOOSING NECESSARY JCL
*         LISTINGS OR OTHER OUTPUT, DIS-ALLOW THE PURGE COMMAND ( $P )
*         FOR JOBS IN EXECUTION.  NOTE THAT THE COMMAND IS DIS-ALLOWED
*         FROM ALL SOURCES, AND THE LOCAL OPERATOR IS ALSO PREVENTED
*         FROM ISSUING IT.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        WITHIN THE AUXILIARY COMMAND PROCESSOR ( SEE JES2B002 ),
*         INTERCEPT '$PJ' COMMANDS, AND DETERMINE IF THE JOB IS CURRENTLY
*         EXECUTING.  IF IT IS EXECUTING,
*     ((( ISSUE THE MESSAGE 'PURGE INVALID - JOB IS EXECUTING' )))
*         AND SET THE COND CODE IN THE PSW TO EQUALITY
*         SO THAT UPON RETURN TO JES2 CODE THE COMMAND PROCESSOR WILL BE
*         BYPASSED.  IF THE JOB IS NOT CURRENTLY EXECUTING, SET THE COND
*         CODE IN THE PSW TO LOW, SO THAT NORMAL JES2 PROCESSING WILL OCCUR.
*
*        ((( MAY 23, 78.  MESSAGE PROCESSING NOT YET WRITTEN )))
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*
*        THIS IS A MONSANTO JES2 MODIFICATION DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT
*        INITIALISATION TIME UPON REQUEST VIA AN 'EXIT=' CONTROL CARD.
*
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        SUBMIT ANY TEST JOB, AND WHEN IT IS EXECUTING, ENTER $PJ
*        COMMAND. IF THE IS NOT PURGED THE TEST IS GOOD AND TERMINATED.
*        IF THE JOB IS PURGED, SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS MOD.
