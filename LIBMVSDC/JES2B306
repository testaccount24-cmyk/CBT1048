***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        EXPAND THE HOLD/RELEASE ALL COMMANDS ( $HA / $AA ), TO ALLOW
*         A RANGE OF REMOTES AND/OR A CLASS TO BE SPECIFIED, THUS -
*              $AA,C=N
*              $HA,C=NT,R=3
*              $HA,C=NT,R=4-5
*        THIS FACILITY GIVES THE LOCAL OPERATOR TOTAL CONTROL OF THE
*         JOBS SUBMITTED FORM ALL LOCATIONS, ENABLING HIM TO STOP AND
*         START JOBSTREAMS FOR ANY COMBINATION OF JOB CLASSES AND SUBMITTING
*         REMOTES.  NOTE THAT SINCE ONLY THE 'SOFT' HOLD BIT IS USED,
*         THE OPERATOR DOES NOT AFFECT ANY SELF-RELEASING JOBSTEAMS.
*         MODIFICATION JES2B305 ( SET SOFT HOLD FOR HELD READERS ) IS ALSO
*         PART OF THIS EXPANDED OPERATOR CONTROL FACILITY.
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THIS WAS MODIFICATION NUMBER 'M031' ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        THIS MODIFICATION IS PART OF THE AUXILIARY COMMAND PROCESSOR.
*         COPY FROM JES2 THE CODE SUPPORTING $AA AND $HA, AND ADD CODE
*         TO SUPPORT THE ADDITIONAL OPERANDS OF CLASS AND REMOTE NUMBER RANGE.
*         BEFORE RETURNING CONTROL TO JES2B002, SET THE COND CODE IN THE PSW
*         EQUAL, SO THAT UPON RETURN TO JES2 THE JES2 COMMAND IS BYPASSED.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*
*        THIS IS A MONSANTO JES2 MODIFICATION DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT
*        INITIALISATION TIME UPON REQUEST VIA AN 'EXIT=' CONTROL CARD.
*
*
***(TESTING)
*
*
*        TO TEST :-
*
*         ENTER $ZI TO STOP INITIATORS
*
*         SUBMIT JOBS 'TESTB306' IN THE JES2 TEST SYSTEM.
*
*         YOU WILL FIND THESE JOBS IN 'LIBRARYN.MVS' DATA SET,
*           MEMBER 'TESTB306', PASSWORD 'T306'.
*
*         50% OF ABOVE JOBS FOR 'AWAITING EXEC' QUEUE WITH DIFFERENT
*         JOB CLASSES AND 50% IN 'PRINT/PUNCH' FOR DIFFERENT DESTINATIONS.
*
*         WHEN JOBS IN Q, TRY $HA/$AA COMMAND WITH THE NEW OPERANDS.
