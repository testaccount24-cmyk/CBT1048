***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THE BRUSSELS PHILOSOPHY TOWARDS JES2 MODIFICATIONS IS TO
*         KEEP AS MUCH CODE AS POSSIBLE EXTERNAL TO JES2, AND TO HAVE
*         NO MORE THAN 1 CARD PER MODIFICATION ACTUALLY WITHIN THE
*         JES2 CODE.  THIS MODIFICATION IS AN AUXILIARY INITIALISATION
*         PROCESSOR THAT CREATES THE NECESSARY ENVIRONMENT FOR THE OTHER
*         MODIFICATIONS, LOADING THEM AND CREATING CONTROL BLOCKS.
*
*        THIS ROUTINE ACCEPTS CONTROL CARDS FROM AN INITIALISATION OPTION
*         DECK.  THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF CONTROL CARDS :-
*              1. 'DCT' CARDS THAT IDENTIFY OPTIONS THAT APPLY TO DEVICES
*              2. 'EXIT' CARDS THAT IDENTIFY ROUTINES THAT ARE TO BE LOADED.
*         EXAMPLES OF THESE CONTROL CARDS ARE :-
*              DCT REMOTE13,REROUTE=10000
*              DCT REMOTE14,REROUTE=10000,CLASSO=YES,ALLCOMM
*              EXIT JES2B604,NOLOAD(JES2B002),SLOT(17)
*              EXIT JES2B602
*              EXIT JES2B999,PCE(17),INIT
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        THE ONLY PART OF THIS MODIFICATION ACTUALLY WITHIN JES2 CODE
*         IS A REQUEST WITHIN JES2 INITIALISATION TO DYNAMICALLY LOAD
*         AND EXECUTE THE AUXILIARY INITIALISATION PROCESSOR.
*
*        THE AUXILIARY INITIALISATION PROCESSOR ITSELF PERFORMS THE
*         FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS :-
*              1. READ THE CONTROL CARDS AND CREATE A TEMPORARY CHAIN OF
*                 DESCRIPTIVE CONTROL BLOCKS.
*              2. DETERMINE THE HIGHEST REMOTE NUMBER ASSIGNED.
*              3. DETERMINE HOW MANY 'EXIT' CONTROL CARDS REQUIRE PCES TO BE
*                 CREATED.
*              4. COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF CORE REQUIRED FOR THE AUXILIARY HCT
*                 ( KNOWN FROM THE DSECT MACRO ), THE AUXILIARY DCTS ( ONE
*                 FOR EACH DEFINED REMOTE ), AND THE AUXILIARY PCES.  GETMAIN
*                 THE CORE AND INITIALISE IT TO LOW VALUES.  ( AN INTERNAL
*                 'GETMAIN' ROUTINE WILL BE USED TO SUBDIVIDE AND ALLOCATE THIS
*                 CORE AS REQUIRED FOR THE CONTROL BLOCKS ).
*              5. SUB-ALLOCATE CORE FOR THE AHCT ( AUXILIARY HCT ), AND SET THE
*                 ADDRESS IN THE PRIMARY HCT.
*              6. FOR EVERY REMOTE CHAINED TO THE PRIMARY HCT, INITIALISE
*                 THE CORRESPONDING ADCT ( IN THE CONTIGUOUS POOL OF ADCTS ),
*                 PRESERVING THE INITIALISATION OPTIONS FROM THE ASSOCIATED
*                 REMOTE DCTS.
*              7. FOR EVERY 'DCT' CONTROL CARD, SET THE APPROPRIATE FLAGS AND
*                 VALUES IT THE RELEVANT ADCT.
*              8. FOR EVERY 'EXIT' CONTROL CARD :-
*                 . FOR THOSE 'EXIT' CARDS THAT DO NOT SPECIFY 'NOLOAD',
*                   ISSUE A BLDL TO VERIFY THAT THE ROUTINE IS AVAILABLE. IF
*                   IT IS NOT, ISSUE A MESSAGE TO THE OPERATOR.
*                 . FOR THOSE 'EXIT' CARDS THAT DO NOT SPECIFY 'NOLOAD',
*                   DYNAMICALLY LOAD THE ROUTINE INTO CORE, AND STORE THE
*                   ADDRESS IN  THE APPROPRIATE SLOT OF THE AHCT.  ( DETERMINE
*                   THE APPROPRIATE SLOT FROM THE ROUTINE NUMBER THAT IS AT
*                   A FIXED DISPLACEMENT FROM THE START OF THE PROGRAM ).
*                 . FOR THOSE 'EXIT' CARDS SPECIFYING 'PCE', SUB-ALLOCATE
*                   CORE FOR A PCE, AND CHAIN IT IN AT THE INDICATED LOCATION
*                 . FOR THOSE 'EXIT' CARDS SPECIFYING 'INIT', PASS CONTROL TO
*                   THE ROUTINE TO ALLOW IT TO PERFORM ITS OWN FURTHER
*                   INITIALISATION.
*                 . FOR THOSE 'EXIT' CARDS SPECIFYING 'NOLOAD', SET THE
*                   'EXITON' FLAG IN THE APPROPRIATE SLOT IN THE AHCT ( THE
*                   SLOT IS IDENTIFIED BY THE 'SLOT(NN)' OPERAND ).
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        VIA '$MODINIT' MACRO, SPECIFIED AT THE END OF MASPINIT PROCESSING :
*
*             $MODINIT PROGRAM=JES2B001                                 M4893520
*
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        THIS MODS CAN BE CONSIDERED AS GOOD, IF ALL THE 'EXIT' AND 'DCT'
*         CONTROL CARDS SUPPLIED AT INITILISATION HAVE BEEN PROCEEDED
*         AND IF NO PROBLEMS WITH THE OTHER MODS.
*
*        IF CURRENT VERSION OF THIS MOD. IS MODIFIED, THE ONLY WAY
*         TO TEST IT IS TO FORCE A DUMP BEFORE B001 RETURN TO JES2
*         AND CHECK IF ALL THE 'EXIT=' AND 'DCT=' REQUESTS HAVE
*         BEEN APPLIED.
