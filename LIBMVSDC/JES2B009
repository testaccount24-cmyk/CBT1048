***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THIS ROUTINE IS A SERVICE ROUTINE THAT EXAMINES THE USER-SPECIFIED
*         PENDING STACK IN THE AHCT, AND, IF ONE EXISTS, REMOVES THE 1ST
*         SECONDARY APCE FROM THE STACK AND CHAINS IT TO THE CALLER'S
*         PRIMARY APCE.
*        THE PURPOSE OF THIS ROUTINE, WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICE
*         ROUTINE JES2B008 ( PASSAPCE ), IS TO PROVIDE A METHOD OF PASSING
*         DATA BETWEEN INDEPENDENT MODIFICATION ROUTINES.  ( SEE THE ABSTRACT
*         FOR JES2B008 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ).

***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        1. EXAMINE THE USER-SPECIFIED PENDING STACK AND REMOVE THE TOP APCE
*           ON THE STACK, IF ONE EXISTS, USING COMPARE-AND-SWAP TO ENSURE
*           QUEUE INTEGRITY.
*        2. CHAIN THE SECONDARY APCE TO THE CALLER'S PRIMARY APCE, USING
*           APCESNXT AS THE ANCHOR OF A PUSH-DOWN STACK.
*        3. SET ON THE FLAG INDICATING THAT THE PRIMARY HAS SECONDARIES.
