***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        IN ORDER TO MAXIMISE THE SPACE AVAILABLE ON DASD, THIS MODIFICATION
*         RELEASES SPACE DOWN TO THE TRACK LEVEL REGARDLESS OF THE UNITS OF
*         SPACE ALLOCATION.
*        THIS MODIFICATION IS RELATED TO THE INSTALLATION STANDARDS -
*         ENFORCED BY THE PROCEDURE 'PROCEDUR' THROUGH WHICH ALL PRODUCTION
*         JCL IS LOADED - THAT:_
*              1. 'RLSE' IS ALWAYS SPECIFIED IN THE SPACE PARAMETER OF NEW AND
*                 MODDED SEQUENTIAL DATA SETS.
*              2. SPACE IS ALWAYS RECODED WITH MODDED DATA SETS.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        1. IN MODULE IGG020P1 :-
*              A) BYPASS ROUNDING TO THE NEAREST CYLINDER FOR 'CYL'
*                 AND 'ROUND' REQUESTS.
*              B) ZEROISE THE SECONDARY EXTENT IN THE FORMAT 1 DSCB
*              C) SET OFF THE CYLINDER ALIGNMENT FLAG IN THE EXTENT DESCRIPTION
*                 IF IT IS IN THE FORMAT 1 DSCB.
*        2. IN MODULE IGG020P2 :-
*              A) SET OFF THE CYLINDER ALIGNMENT FLAG IN THE RELEVANT EXTENT
*                 DESCRIPTION IF IT IS IN THE FORMAT 3 DSCB.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        1. RUN THE JOB ON 'LIBRARYN.MVS' NAMED 'TRKRLSE'.  THIS JOB
*           IS A SUPERZAP IN SMP FORMAT.
