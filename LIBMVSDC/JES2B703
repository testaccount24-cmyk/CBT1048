***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THE DATA/100 MODEL 70 SIMULATES A 2780 TERMINAL, AND THE
*         WRITE WITHOUT SPACING CARRIAGE CONTROL CHARACTER IS DIFFERENT
*         AS THE ONE SPECIFIED IN THE BASIC HASP/JES2. BECAUSE ALL THE 2780
*         TERMINALS USED IN MONSANTO ARE DATA 100 MODEL 70 EQUIPMENTS,
*         THIS MODIFICATION WILL FORCE TO USE THE DATA 100 CARRIAGE
*         CONTROL CHARACTER.
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THIS WAS INCLUDED WITH MODIFICATION 'M060' ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        AT AN APPROPRIATE POINT WITHIN THE DC'S DESCRIPTIONS
*        IN 'HASPRTAM' MODULE, THE FOLLOWING CARD :
