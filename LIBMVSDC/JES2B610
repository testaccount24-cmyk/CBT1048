***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        WITH THE INCREASING WORKFLOW AND CONCOMITANT INCREASE IN LOCAL
*         CONSOLE ACTIVITY, OPERATIONS ARE CONCERNED THAT CRITICAL JCL
*         ERROR MESSAGES MAY BE OVERLOOKED BY THE LOCAL OPERATOR.  TO
*         PRECLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF OVERLOOKING SUCH CRITICAL ERRORS,
*         THEY REQUIRE A MECHANISM TO HIGHLIGHT JCL ERROR MESSAGES ( FOR
*         PRODUCTION JOBS ONLY ) IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE OPERATOR CANNOT
*         OVERLOOK THEM.
*
*        ( THERE WAS NO EQUIVALENT MODIFICATION UNDER HASP ).
