***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        ALTHOUGH THE PHILOSOPHY OF OUR JES2 CHANGES IS TO KEEP THEM
*         EXTERNAL TO JES2 ITSELF, WE WAVE TO ACCEPT THE OCCASIONAL NECESSITY
*         OF MODIFYING JES2.  SPECIFICALLY, WE HAVE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO
*         MODIFY THE JQE ( JOB QUEUE ELEMENT ) TO CONTAIN SOME OF OUR JOB-
*         ORIENTED FLAGS AND DATA.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        A NUMBER OF FIELDS ARE ADDED TO THE END OF THE JQE.
*         SEE BAL SOURCE OF JES2AJQE MEMBER.

***(INSTALLATION)

*        SEE 'JES2INST'.
