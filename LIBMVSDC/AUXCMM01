***(ABSTRACT)
*
*          THIS MODULE IS THE SECONDARY COMMAND ROUTER FOR THE #D
*        (ALIAS 'DD') COMMAND. IT IS INVOKED BY THE MAIN COMMAND ROUTER
*        AUXCOMM WHEN A #D COMMAND IS ENETRED BY THE OPERATOR. INPUT
*        TO THIS ROUTINE IS THE EXTENDED SAVE AREA OF THE OS COMMAND
*        PROCESSOR - SVC34.
*          THIS MODULE EXAMINES THE FIRST OPERAND CODED IN THE COMMAND
*        AND ROUTES CONTROL TO ONE OF THE OTHER AUXCOMM ROUTINES IF A VALID
*        SUBOPERAND IS FOUND. IF THE OPERAND IS A QUERY, ('?'), THE MODULE
*        LISTS ALL THE OPERANDS IT CONSIDERS VALID AND THEIR FUNCTION.
*          IF THE COMMAND ENTERED IS A LONG ONE, (E.G. DD CPU), THEN THE
*        PROCESSOR IS ATTACHED INSTEAD OF BEING INVOKED DIRECTLY. THIS
*        IS TO PREVENT HOLDING UP THE COMMUNICATIONS TASK
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*         THE ROUTINE EXTRACTS THE ADDRESS OF THE OPERAND LIST FROM THE
*        EXTENDED SAVE AREA OF THE SVRB FOR SVC34. THIS IS THEN ANALYSED
*        USING THE SCAN MACRO TO BUILD DESCRIPTOR BLOCKS FOR EACH OPERAND
*        CODED.
*          THE FIRST OPERAND IS THEN COMPARED WITH A TABLE OF VALID
*        OPERANDS AND THE ADDRESS OF THE APPROPRIATE PROCESSING ROUTINE
*        EXTRACTED. A BRANCH AND LINK IS ISSUED TO INVOKE THE ROUTINE.
*        NORMALLY THIS WOULD BE THE PROCESSING ROUTINE ITSELF, BUT FOR
*        CERTAIN LONG COMMANDS, IT IS THE ADDRESS OF AN ATTACH ROUTINE
*        WHICH WILL ATTACH THE PROCESSOR AS A SUBTASK.
*          REGISTER 15 IS USED TO COMMUNICATE SUCCESS OR FAILURE BETWEEN THE
*        DIFFERENT ROUTINES AND THE COMMAND ROUTER.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*          THE MODULE IS ASSEMBLED AND LINK EDITTED INTO THE LOAD MODULE
*        AUXCOMM WHICH MUST RESIDE ON SYS1.LINKLIB. A COMPLETE JOB TO
*        EFFECT THIS IS ON LIBRARYN.MVS UNDER THE NAME AUXCMM01. SIMPLY
*        RUN THIS JOB TO LINK AUXCMM01 WITH THE OTHER ROUTINES OF AUXCOMM.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*          TO TEST THIS MODULE IT IS NECCESSARY TO HAVE IT LINKED INTO
*        SYS1.LINKLIB AS ABOVE AND ISSUE THE #D ? COMMAND ( ALIAS DD ?).
*        THIS SHOULD RESULT IN A DISPLAY OF THE VALID OPERANDS WHICH CAN
*        THEN BE ENTERED. JOBS WARNING.RUN, WARNING.RUN2, & WARNING.RUN3
*        ON JEA CMS WILL CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT NECCESSARY TO TEST THE
*        OPERATION OF THE VARIOUS OPERANDS.
