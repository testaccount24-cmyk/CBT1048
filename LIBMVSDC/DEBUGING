***(ABSTRACT)
*
*            THIS MODIFICATION ALLOWS INSTALLATION WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION
*        MEMBERS TO BE AUTOMATICALLY PRINTED AS PART OF THE NORMAL
*        SYSUDUMP OR SYSABEND OUTPUT FROM A SYSTEM OR USER ABEND. WHEN THE
*        ABEND OCCURS, A PRE-DETERMINED DATA SET IS ALLOCATED, OPENED AND
*        SEARCHED FOR A MEMBER WHOSE NAME MATCHES THE ABEND CODE. IF ONE
*        IS FOUND, IT IS PRINTED AT THE START OF THE DUMP OUTPUT.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*            THE ROUTINE IS ENTERED FORM THE MONSANTO DUMP MODIFICATION
*        CONTROL ROUTINE (JEAVAD02) WHEN AN ABEND OCCURS IN A JOB STEP
*        WHICH INCLUDES A SYSUDUMP OR SYSABEND DD CARD.
*            FIRSTLY, THE DATA SET 'SYS1.DEBUGING' IS DYNAMICALLY OPENED
         AND A MEMBER NAME CONSTRUCTED FROM THE ABEND CODE FOR THE STEP.
*            THE DATA SET (A PDS) IS SEARCHED FOR A MEMBER OF THIS NAME
*        AND, IF ONE IS FOUND, THEN IT IS PRINTED ONE CARD PER LINE. IF
*        NO MEMBER IS FOUND, A MESSAGE IS OUTPUT TO REPORT THE FACT.
*            SOME MEMBERS MAY CONTAIN REFERENCES TO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE
*        DEBUGGING LIBRARY AND, IN THIS CASE, AN 'INCLUDE' CARD FOR THE
*        OTHER MEMBER(S) MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE INPUT. FOR EACH MEMBER
*        REFERENCED BY AN INCLUDE CARD, ALL THE DATA CONTAINED IN IT WILL BE
*        PRINTED ONCE ONLY.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*             THE ROUTINE IS INVOKED DYNAMICALLY FROM THE LINK LIST BY
*        JEAVAD02 EACH TIME AN ABEND OCCURS. IT MUST BE LINK EDITED ONTO
*        SYS1.MLPALIB ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER DUMP MODS AND HAVE AN ENTRY
*        POINT NAME OF 'IEAVADDB'. THE ROUTINE IS REENTRANT AND EXECUTES
*        IN SUPERVISOR MODE PROTECT KEY ZERO.
