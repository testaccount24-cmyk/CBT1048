***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        IN ORDER TO GIVE TOTAL CONTROL TO EACH REMOTE TERMINAL
*         OPERATOR REGARDING THEIR OWN PRINT/PUNCH QUEUE. THIS
*         MOD WILL SET THE JOB IN 'HARD' HOLD STATUS EACH TIME
*         A JOB IS QUEUED IN HARDCOPY QUEUE FOR A REMOTE TERMINAL.
*
*        OPTIONALLY THE 'SET JOB IN HARD HOLD' CAN BE BYPASSED
*         FOR A REMOTE, BY SPECIFYING 'NOHOLDOUT' OPERAND IN THE
*         'DCT=' CONTROL CARD OF THIS REMOTE.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        AT APPROPRIATE PLACE IN THE HASP JOB QUEUE MANAGER ROUTINE
*         ($QADD) IN 'HASPNUC' MODULE, EXIT WITH A $CBAL, THUS :-
*
*           $CBAL JES2B317               P0806000
*
*         IN THE EXIT ITSELF, TEST IF CURRENT JOB WILL BE QUEUED
*          IN '$HARDCPY' QUEUE.
*               IF NO, RETURN TO JES2.
*               IF YES, USE THE JQE PRINT AND PUNCH ROUTE CODES
*                TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE ADCT'S. IF PRINT AND PUNCH
*                ROUTE CODES = 0 (LOCAL), RETURN TO JES2.
*
*         WITH THE ADCT'S, TEST IF 'NOHOLDOUT' FLAG IS ON.
*
*               IF YES (FOR BOTH PRINT/PUNCH), RETURN TO JES2.
*               IF NO (EVEN FOR ONE), SET THE JOB IN 'HARD' HOLD
*                STATUS AND RETURN TO JES2.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*         THIS MODIFICATION IS DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT INITILISATION TIME
*          UPON REQUEST VIA AN 'EXIT=' CONTROL CARD.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*         CHECK IF DURING THE TESTS OF THE OTHER MODS THE JOBS IN OUTPUT
*          QUEUE FOR REMOTES ARE HELD.
