***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        JEAVAD02 IS A MODULE WHICH RUNS AS PART OF IGC0005A (SNAP).
*        BY VIRTUE OF ITS BEING INVOKED DYNAMICALLY BY THE DRIVER XEAVAD02
*        (A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE REAL MODULE IEAVAD02), IT IS INVOKED AFTER
*        THE JOBNAME AND COMPLETION CODE HAVE BEEN PRINTED. THE MODULE
*        WILL, FOR ALL OCX ABENDS, FORMAT & PRINT THE FAILING
*        INSTRUCTION AND ITS OFFSET IN THE PROGRAM (IF APPLICABLE).
*        FOR CERTAIN ABEND CODES, THE MODULE WILL GO ON TO FORMAT
*        THE REGISTERS INVOLVED AND THE DATA AREAS REFERENCED BY THE
*        FAILING INSTRUCTION. FURTHER MODIFICATIONS ARE INCLUDED TO
*        SUPPRESS UNNECCESSARY INFORMATION WHEN A SYSUDUMP (AS OPPOSED
*        TO A SYSABEND) IS REQUESTED.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*              ***** NOT YET DEFINED *****
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        INSTALLATION IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO THAT OF IEAVADDM.
*        A JOB EXISTS TO INSTALL THE MODULE. IT IS JEAVAD02 ON LIBRARYN-
*        MVS. TO REMOVE THE MODULE RUN JOB IEAVREST (AGAIN ON LIBRARYN-
*        MVS). THIS JOB WILL ALSO REMOVE IEAVADDM.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        PROGRAM 'TESTDUMP' ON JEA.LOADLIB' IS BEING USED TO TEST THE
*        MODULE BY FORCING A SERIES OF DIFFERENT ABENDS.
