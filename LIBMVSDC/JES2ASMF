***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        ALTHOUGH THE SMF DOCUMENTATION PRETENDS THAT THE TYPE 26
*         RECORD ( JOB ENTRY SUB-SYSTEM JOB PURGE RECORD ) CONTAINS THE
*         ACCOUNTING DATA FROM THE JOB CARD, THIS IN FACT ONLY APPLIES TO
*         JES3.  OUR CHARGE-OUT SYSTEM REQUIRES THAT THE FIRST 5 FIELDS
*         OF THE ACCOUNTING DATA BE AVAILABLE IN THE 'HASP' RECORDS
*         CREATED FROM SMF26 RECORDS, AND SO WE ADDED FIELDS TO CONTAIN
*         THE THIRD, FOURTH AND FIFTH PARAMATERS ( THE FIRST TWO ARE
*         PRESERVED IN THE RECORD BY JES2 ).
*
*        ( THERE WAS NO EQUIVALENT MODIFICATION UNDER HASP ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        A NUMBER OF FIELDS ARE ADDED TO THE END OF THE SMF26
*         SEE BAL SOURCE OF JES2ASMF MEMBER.

***(INSTALLATION)

*        SEE 'JES2INST'.
