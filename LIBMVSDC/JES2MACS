***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        A NUMBER OF MACROS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN TO SIMPLIFY CODING JES2
*         MODIFICATION ROUTINES.  THESE MACROS ARE :-
*         .$ADCT    - CREATE DSECT FOR AUXILIARY DEVICE CONTROL TABLE
*         .$AHCT    - CREATE DSECT FOR AUXILIARY HASP COMMUNICATION TABLE
*         .$APCE    - CREATE DSECT FOR AUXILIARY PROCESSOR CONTROL ELEMENT
*         .$CBAL    - PASS CONTROL FROM JES2 CODE TO A MODIFICATION ROUTINE
*         .$MODEXIT - PASS CONTROL FROM A SEGMENT BACK TO THE MAIN PROGRAM
*         .$MODLINK - PASS CONTROL FROM THE MAIN PROGRAM TO A SEGMENT
*         .$MODMID  - CREATE A MESSAGE IDENTIFIER FOR A MODIFICATION ROUTINE
*         .$MODNTRY - DEFINE AN ENTRY POINT FOR A MAIN PROGRAM OR A SEGMENT
*         .$MODRET  - PASS CONTROL FROM A MODIFICATION ROUTINE BACK TO JES2 CODE
*         .$MODXCTL - PASS CONTROL FROM ONE SEGMENT TO ANOTHER
*         .$SUBIN   - DEFINE AN ENTRY POINT FOR AN INTERNAL SUBROUTINE
*         .$SUBOUT  - DEFINE AN EXIT FROM AN INTERNAL SUBROUTINE
*
*        ALL THE MACROS RESPOND TO THE KEYWORD 'DOC=YES', PRINTING INFORMATION
*         ABOUT THE CORRECT FORM OF THE MACRO, THE PURPOSE OF THE POSSIBLE
*         OPERANDS, AND A BRIEF DESCRIPTION AS TO ITS PURPOSE.  ALL MACROS
*         ARE CODED IN JES2B000 ( THE MODIFICATION ROUTINE DISPATCHER ) WITH
*         DOC=YES SPECIFIED, FOR DOCUMENTATION PURPOSES.
