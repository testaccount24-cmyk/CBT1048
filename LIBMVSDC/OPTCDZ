***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        ON DRIVES WITH ROTATIONAL POSITION SENSING, THE MANUALS INDICATE
*         THAT READING WITH THE 'READ DIRECT' OPTION IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE
*         EFFICIENT THAN READING WITHOUT THE 'READ DIRECT OPTION', BECAUSE
*         THE CHANNEL IS AVAILABLE DURING THE DURATION OF THE SET SECTOR
*         COMMAND ISSUED BY READ DIRECT.
*        THE READ DIRECT OPTION IS AUTOMATICALLY INVOKED FOR SEQUENTIAL INPUT
*         DASD DATA SETS ON DEVICES WITH ROTATIONAL POSITION SENSING, PROVIDED
*         THAT THE DATA SET HAS STANDARD BLOCKS ( I.E. FS OR FBS ).
*         UNFORTUNATELY, MOST OF OUR DATA SETS ARE NOT CREATED AS HAVING
*         STANDARD BLOCKS, AND THE ABUNDANCE OF RPGE AND COBE PROGRAMS MAKES
*         IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION AT EXECUTION TIME.  HOWEVER,
*         THE READ DIRECT OPTION MAY BE STIMULATED BY SPECIFYING OPTCD=Z, AND
*         ( ACCORDING TO THE MANUALS ) THIS WILL WORK EVEN IF THE DATA SET
*         CONTAINS SHORT BLOCKS ( I.E. IS NOT FBS FORMAT ).
*        THE FUNCTION OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO FORCE OPTCD=Z AT OPEN TIME
*         FOR ALL SEQUENTIAL, INPUT, NON-FBS, DASD DATA SETS ON RPS DEVICES,
*         THUS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF READ DIRECT PROCESSING DESPITE IBM'S
*         REMARKABLY RESTRICTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF IT.
