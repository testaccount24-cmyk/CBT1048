***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        BETWEEN JES2 4.0 AND 4.1 FOUR FIELDS OF FOUR BYTES EACH
*         HAVE BEEN REMOVED IN THE MIDDLE OF SMF26 RECORDS, TO
*         AVOID TO CHANGE THE COST PROGRAMS USING SMF26 AND TO
*         CONTINUE TO SAVE SMF RECORDS IN THE SAME HISTORIC FILES,
*         THE 4-FIELD (UNUSED) HAVE BEEN RESTORED TO BE COMPATIBLE
*         WITH THE 4.0 FORMAT.
*
*        THE IDEA OF THIS MOD. IS TO MAKE COST SYSTEM INDEPENDENT OF
*         SMF26 RECORD FORMAT, BY CREATING AN ADDITIONAL SMF RECORD
*         THAT WILL HAVE THE SAME FORMAL AS THE OLD 'HASP' RECORD.
*         'HASP' RECORD FORMAT THAT IS STILL USED EVERYWHERE IN THE
*         COST SYSTEM.
*

*
*        THIS IS A MONSANTO JES2 MODIFICATION DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT
*        INITIALISATION TIME UPON REQUEST VIA AN 'EXIT=' CONTROL CARD.
*
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        DUMP THE SMF RECORDS AND LOOK AT THEM, TO DO THAT,
*         SEE 'TESTING' OF JES2B405 MOD.
