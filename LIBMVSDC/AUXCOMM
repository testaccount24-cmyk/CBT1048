***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        THIS MODIFICATION IS ADDITIONAL COMMAND ROUTER. THE MVS COMMAND
*         PROCESSOR IS RE-LINKED TO INCLUDE A SMALL MODULE (XEE0503D)
*         WHICH TAKES THE PLACE OF THE NORMAL ERROR MESSAGE ROUTINE
*         (IEE0503D). THIS MODULE INVOKES AUXCOMM AND THEN PASSES CONTROL,
*         IF NECCESSARY, TO THE REAL IEE0503D. AUXCOMM SETS R15 TO CALL THE
*         ERROR ROUTINE WHEN IT ENCOUNTERS A COMMAND IT CANNOT RECOGNISE.
*         AUXCOMMN ROUTES THOSE COMMANDS THAT IT DOES RECOGNISE
*         TO THE APPROPRIATE PROCESSING ROUTINE WHICH WILL HANDLE IT.
*        THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS ROUTINE IS TO PROVIDE A SIMPLE WAY OF
*         ADDING PERFORMANCE MONITORING ORIENTED COMMANDS INTO THE SYSTEM.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        THIS ROUTER ANALYSES THE INPUT COMMAND, AND ATTEMPTS TO RECOGNISE
*         IT.  IF THE COMMAND IS RECOGNISED, CONTROL IS PASSED TO THE
*         APPROPRIATE PROCESSING ROUTINE VIA BAL.   IF THE COMMAND IS
*         UNRECOGNISABLE, CONTROL IS RETURNED TO CALLER WITH R15 NON-ZERO.
*         IF THE INPUT COMMAND IS '?', THEN THE COMMAND ROUTER PROCESSES IT
*         DIRECTLY BY BUILDING UP A STRING OF MESSAGES IDENTIFYING EVERY
*         AUXILIARY COMMAND THAT MAY BE USED, WITH A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF
*         ITS FUNCTION, AND XCTLING TO AUXCMM00 TO ISSUE THE MESSAGES.
*         ( THE USER MAY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BY ISSUING A SPECIFIC
*         COMMAND WITH AN OPERAND FIELD OF '?' ).
*
*        TO RECOGNISE AND PROCESS COMMANDS, AUXCOMM USES AN INTERNAL TABLE
*         WITH ENTRIES OF THE FORM :-
*              DC    AL1(L'WXYZ-1) EXECUTABLE LENGTH OF THE COMMAND
*        WXYZ  DC    C'WXYZ'       COMMAND
*              DC    CL8'MODULE-NAME' NAME OF PROCESSING RTN
*              DC    V(MODULE-NAME) ADDRESS OF PROCESSING RTN
*              DC    AL1(L'WXYZD-1) EXECUTABLE LENGTH OF DESCRIPTION
*        WXYZD DC    C'BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF COMMAND'
*
*         ( IN A COMMAND HAS BOTH A SHORT AND A LONG FORM, THERE MUST BE
*         AN ENTRY IN THE TABLE FOR EACH ).
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*          THE PRIMARY AIM IN DESIGNING THE INSTALLATION METHOD FOR THE
*        AUXILIARY COMMANDS IS TO MINIMISE TH EFFORT REQUIRED AND THE
*        EFFECT ON THE SYSTEM ITSELF. FOR THIS REASON, NO SYSTEM ROUTINES
*        ARE DIRECTLY MODIFIED AT ALL. INSTEAD, THE LINKAGE EDITOR IS
*        USED TO 'INSERT' A BASIC LINKAGE ROUTINE INTO THE NORMAL O.S.
*        COMMAND PROCESSOR - SVC34.
*          THIS BASIC ROUTINE CONSISTS ONLY OF A LINK INSTRUCTION TO
*        AUXCOMM AND IS CALLED 'XEE0503D'. IT IS LOADED INTO THE SYSTEM
*        BY RE-LINKING IGC0003D TO INCLUDE IT AS'IEE0503D'. ALL NORMAL
*        REFERENCES TO THAT MODULE ARE SUBSEQUENTLY RE-ROUTED TO XEE0503D
*        WHICH PASSES CONTROL ON, AFTER IT HAS INVOKED AUXCOMM, TO THE
*        REAL IEE0503D.
*          THE RE-LINKED VERSION OF IGC0003D IS HELD ON SYS1.LINKLIB,
*        AND A MEMBER OF PARMLIB (IEALPAXX) CREATED TO CONTAIN THE
*        PARAMETER CARD - 'SYS1.LINKLIB IGC0003D ', WHERE THE XX OF
*        IEALPAXX IS ANY COMBINATION OF NUMBERS AND LETTERS NOT ALREADY
*        IN USE BY THE INSTALLATION.
*          AT IPL, IN RESPONSE TO O.S'S FIRST MESSAGE, THIS PARMLIB
*        MEMBER IS REFERENCED BY THE REPLY - 'R 00,LPA=XX', WHICH
*        CAUSES THE RE-LINKED VERSION OF THE COMMAND PROCESSOR TO BE
*        INCLUDED IN THE MODIFIED LINK PACK AREA AND USED INSTEAD OF THE
*        NORMAL ONE IN THE LINK PACK AREA ITSELF.
*          WHEN A COMMAND IS ISSUED BY THE OPERATOR, THE NEW VERSION OF
*        SVC34 IS GIVEN CONTROL AND SUBSEQUENTLY, FOR COMMANDS IT DOES NOT
*        RECOGNISE, PASSES CONTROL TO AUXCOMM.
*          IN THIS WAY THE NEW COMMANDS CAN BE EASILY ADDED TO ANY MVS
*        SYSTEM AND JUST AS EASILY REMOVED IN CASE OF PROBLEMS ETC.
*
*        JOBS IEE0503D AND AUXCOMM ON LIBRARYN.MVS WILL PERFORM THE
*        NECCESSARY LINKS TO LOAD THE AUXILIARY COMMAND PROCESSOR.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        RUN THE JOB TO LOAD THE AUXILIARY COMMAND PROCESSOR AND ISSUE ONE.
