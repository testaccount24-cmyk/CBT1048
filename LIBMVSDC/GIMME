***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        UNDER HASP 3.1 WE DEVELOPED A PROGRAM - BASED UPON A PROGRAM
*         OBTAINED FROM ST.LOUIS - THAT ENABLED THE OPERATOR TO UNLOAD
*         JOBS FROM SPOOL TO TAPE, AND TO SUBSEQUENTLT RESTORE THEM.
*         THIS IS EXTREMELY USEFUL OPERATIONALLY, AND WE HAVE NO DESIRE
*         TO RELINQUISH THE FACILITY, SO THIS DESCRIBES THE MVS/JES2
*         EQUIVALENT.  IT IS BASED - VERY LOOSELY - UPON THE IUP 5798-CKJ
*         ( HASP-JES2 SPOOL TRANSFER PROGRAM ).
*
*        AS WITH ALL OTHER RESOURCES, SPOOL USAGE EXPANDS TO MEET THE
*         AVAILABILITY OF THE RESOURCE, AND - PARTICULARLY IN A BATCH RJE
*         ENVIRONMENT - SPOOL BECOMES FULL NO MATTER WHAT SIZE IT IS.
*         GIMME IS THE INTELLIGENT ALTERNATIVE TO INDEFINITELY INCREASING
*         THE AMOUNT OF SPOOL SPACE AVAILABLE, SINCE BY UNLOADING TO TAPE
*         THE SPOOL SPACE IS ESSENTIALLY UNLIMITED.
*
*        GIMME MAY BE USED NOT ONLY TO UNLOAD INDIVIDUAL JOBS TO TAPE IN
*         ORDER TO FREE UP SPOOL SPACE, BUT ALSO TO SIMPLIFY INITIALISING
*         A NEW SPOOL PACK, SINCE IT IS NO LONGER NECESSARY TO EMPTY
*         THE SPOOL VOLUME, BUT MERELY TO UNLOAD IT TO TAPE, AND TO RESTORE
*         THE TAPE TO THE NEW SPOOL PACK.
*
*         THE HASP-TO-JES SPOOL TRANSFER PROGRAM ( HJSTP )  WAS
*         ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO BE A CONVERSION AID, AND CONSEQUENTLY IT
*         DOES NOT PERFORM ALL THE FUNCTIONS THAT WE REQUIRE, AND NOR DOES
*         IT PERFORM ITS FUNCTIONS IN THE WAY WHICH WE REQUIRE.
*
*        FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE SPOOL TRANSFER PROGRAM, REFER TO
*         DOCUMENTATION MODULE 'HJSTP'.  BRIEFLY, THE PROGRAM PERFORMS
*         THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS :-
*              .READ JOBS FROM SPOOL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SELECTION
*               CRITERIA SPECIFIED ON ( COMPLEX ) CONTROL CARDS.
*              .REFORMAT EACH SELECTED JOB AS A SERIES OF IEBGENER JOBS
*               THAT WILL RECREATE THE ORIGINAL PRINT OUTPUT
*              .ISSUE A $P COMMAND TO THE INTERNAL READER TO PURGE THE JOB
*               FROM THE SYSTEM
*
*        OUR REQUIREMENTS OF THE PACKAGE ARE THAT IT :-
*              1. INTERACT WITH THE OPERATOR TO ALLOW HIM TO SPECIFY
*                 THE PROCESSING REQUIRED VIA THE CONSOLE.
*                 THE OPERATOR WILL BE ABLE TO UNLOAD ANY OR ALL JOBS IN
*                 ANY SEQUENCE, AND ACCORDING TO A NUMBER OF SELECTION
*                 CRITERIA.
*              2. UNLOAD TO TAPE JOBS AWAITING EXECUTION, AS WELL AS
*                 JOBS AWAITING OUTPUT.
*              3. AUTOMATICALLY FREE THE ASSOCIATED SPOOL SPACE WHEN
*                 THE JOB HAS BEEN UNLOADED TO TAPE.
*              4. SUPPLY JES2 WITH THE NECESSARY INFORMATION SO THAT
*                 JES2 CONTINUES TO BE AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE JOB,
*                 AND KNOWS THAT IT IS ON TAPE ( AND ON WHICH TAPE ).
*              5. SUBSEQUENTLY, READ THE TAPE, AND RE-CONSTITUTE ALL THE
*                 JOBS UPON IT, RETAINING THE SAME JOB NUMBERS.
*              6. PRODUCE, UPON REQUEST, A STATUS REPORT SHOWING THE
*                 STATUS OF ALL JOBS IN THE SYSTEM.
*
*        IN ORDER TO RECREATE THE FACILITIES AND FEATURES THAT WE REQUIRE
*         WE PROPOSE TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING MODIFICATIONS, SOME OF WHICH
*         ARE TO THE SPOOL TRANSFER PROGRAM AND SOME OF WHICH ARE TO
*         JES2:-
