***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        JES2 COMPUTES A PRIORITY FOR JOBS ON THE EXECUTION QUEUE BASED
*         UPON ESTIMATED CPU TIME AND ESTIMATED OUTPUT LINES.  THIS RESULTS
*         IN A RANGE OF PRIORITYS THAT IS, IN OUR ENVIRONMENT, TOTALLY
*         IRRELEVANT, BECAUSE WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN SCHEDULING JOBS BASED
*         UPON SUCH PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES ( ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE HIGH DEFAULT
*         VALUES ASSIGNED TO PRODUCTION JOBS RESULT IN VERY LOW PRIORITIES ).
*        THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO SET A PRIORITY OF 7 FOR
*         ALL JOBS AWAITING EXECUTION, UNLESS THE PRIORITY IS SPECIFICALLY
*         SET BY A /*PRIORITY CARD.
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THIS WAS MODIFICATION 'M033' ).
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        THIS MODIFICATION IS INVOKED BY AN UNQUALIFIED $CBAL IMMEDIATELY
*         AFTER JES2 HAS COMPUTED A PRIORITY.  THE MODIFICATION SUBSTITUTES
*         A DEFAULT PRIORITY OF 7 UNLESS THE JOB WAS PRECEDED BY A /*PRIORITY
*         CARD, IN WHICH CASE THE PRIORITY CARD VALUE IS LEFT.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        THIS IS A MONSANTO JES2 MOD DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT
*        INITIALISATION TIME UPON REQUEST VIA AN 'EXIT=' CONTROL CARD.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        ALL THE JOBS SUBMITTED TO TEST THE OTHER MODS MUST BE
*         IN AWAITING EXECUTION QUEUE WITH PRIORITY 7.
*                                                   =
*                                                   =
