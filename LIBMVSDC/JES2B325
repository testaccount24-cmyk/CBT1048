***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        UNTIL SUCH TIME AS WE IMPLEMENT A CHARGE-OUT SYSTEM THAT MAKES
*         A SURCHARGE FOR THE USE OF A HIGH PRIORITY, WE WISH TO RESTRICT
*         THE USE OF /*PRIORITY CARDS AND THE PRTY OPERAND IN THE JOBCARD.
*         ANOTHER MODIFICATION ALREADY LIMITS THE USE OF /*PRIORITY CARDS
*         TO SPECIFIC REMOTES, AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO
*         IGNORE ANY 'PRTY' OPERANDS IN JOB CARDS.
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THERE WAS NO EQUIVALENT MODIFICATION ).
