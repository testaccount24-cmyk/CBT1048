***(ABSTRACT)
*
*     BY ISSUING A $DC COMMAND, THE LOCAL OPERATOR MAY CAUSE RE-DISPLAY
*        OF ALL /*CONTROL CARDS IN A SPECIFIED JOB. ORIGINATION,ROUTING,

***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*  1     HASPCOMM WILL RECOGNIZE THE $DC COMMAND FROM A LOCAL CONSOLE
*          AND BUILD A 'RECALL REQUEST QUEUE ELEMENT' (RRQE).
*  2     THE REQUESTING CONSOLE ID WILL BE SAVED IN THE RRQE.
*  3     THE RRQE WILL BE CHAINED ONTO THE RECALL REQUEST QUEUE AND
*          THE RECALL PROCESSOR $POSTED FOR WORK.
*  4     THE RECALL PROCESSOR (CCRP) WILL, WHEN POSTED FOR WORK,
*          PROCESS ONE RRQE AT A TIME.
*  5     THE JQE,JCT, AND IOT FOR THE SPECIFIED JOB WILL BE ACCESSED
*          AND THE JCL IMAGE DATA SET WILL BE SCANNED FOR /*CONTROL
*          CARDS. ANY FOUND WILL BE ISSUED AS TEXT TO THE CONSOLE
*          IDENTIFIED IN THE RRQE ALONG WITH THE ORIG,ROUTING, AND
*          STATUS INFO.
*  6     WHEN ALL RRQE'S HAVE BEEN DE-QUEUED AND PROCESSED, THE
*          PROCESSOR WILL $WAIT FOR WORK.
