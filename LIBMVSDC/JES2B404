***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        ALTHOUGH THE SMF MANUAL WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE THAT THE SMF26 ( JOB
*         PURGE ) RECORD CONTAINS ALL THE ACCOUNTING FIELDS FROM THE JOB CARD,
*         THIS FIELD IN FACT ONLY APPLIES TO JES3.  SINCE OUR CHARGE-OUT
*         SYSTEM REQUIRES THE FIRST 5 ACCOUNTING FIELDS, THEN IT WAS INCUMBENT
*         UPON US TO ADD THE DATA TO THE SMF26 RECORDS.
*        THIS MODIFICATION ADDS THE THIRD, FOURTH AND FIFTH ACCOUNTING FIELDS
*         TO ADDITIONAL SMF FIELDS ( CREATED BY MODIFICTAION JES2ASMF ).  NOTE
*         THAT THE FIRST TWO ACCOUNTING FIELDS ARE ALREADY PRESERVED IN THE
*         SMF26 RECORD BY JES2, ALTHOUGH THEY DO NOT CONTAIN WHAT IT THINKS
*         THAT THEY DO.
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THERE WAS NO EQUIVALENT MODIFICATION ).
*
*       ***********
*       *ATTENTION*
*       ***********
*           THIS MOD IS ALSO USED TO MOVE FROM JCT TO SMF26 ANY
*            ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CREATED BY SEVERAL OTHER MODS.
*            THIS MEANS THAT THIS MOD. IS NOT INDEPENDENT.
*             DECEMBER 1977 - JES2B405 CREATED FIVE ADD. JCT FIELDS
*             ............. - .....................................
*             ............. - .....................................

***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*        THIS MODIFICATION IS ENTERED VIA AN UNQUALIFIED $CBAL IN HASPMISC
*         ( AT STATEMENT N0930200 ) AFTER THE BASIC SMF26 RECORD HAS BEEN
*         CONSTRUCTED, AND BEFORE THE SMF RECORD HAS BEEN WRITTEN.
*        THE ADDITIONAL FLAG BYTE IS SET TO 0, AND THE ACCOUNTING FIELDS
*         MAJOR COST CENTRE, MINOR COST CENTRE AND ENTITY CODE ARE MOVED TO
*         THE ADDITIONAL SMF FIELDS FROM THE JCT.
*
*        DECEMBER 1977.
*        ===============
*        THE FIVE ADDITIONAL JCT FIELDS CREATED BY 'JES2B405' MOD
*         ARE ALSO STORED INTO SMF26 BY THIS MOD.
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*
*        THIS IS A MONSANTO JES2 MODIFICATION DYNAMICALLY LOADED AT
*        INITIALISATION TIME UPON REQUEST VIA AN 'EXIT=' CONTROL CARD.
