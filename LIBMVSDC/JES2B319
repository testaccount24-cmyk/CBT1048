***(ABSTRACT)
*
*        WE HAVE DISCOVERED ( THE HARD WAY ) THAT IF MORE THAN 1 LOCATION
*         SUBMITS AN UNQUALIFIED $DN WHILE THERE IS A LARGE JOB QUEUE,
*         THE LOCAL OPERATOR IS LOCKED OUT BY A $WTO BUFFER SHORTAGE, AND
*         IT IS NECESSARY TO RE-IPL TO RECOVER.  SINCE THE CONTENTS OF OUR
*         TOTAL JOB QUEUE SHOULD BE A MATTER OF TOTAL IRRELEVANCE TO THE
*         REMOTE OPERATORS, WE HAVE DECIDED TO ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM BY
*         DISALLOWING UNQUALIFIED $DN COMMANDS FROM REMOTES ( EXCEPT FOR
*         THOSE REMOTES ASSIGNED 'ALLCOMM' ATTRIBUTE IN THE DCT CONTROL
*         CARD ).
*
*        ( UNDER HASP 3.1 THIS WAS MODIFICATION 'M' ).
