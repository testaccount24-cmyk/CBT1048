***(ABSTRACT)
*
*              THE BASIC IPO IOGEN PROCEDURE IS DESCRIBED IN SECTION
*        THREE OF THE IBM SUPPLIED IPO DOCUMENTATION.
*        BEFORE FOLLOWING THIS PROCEDURE, REFERENCE SHOULD BE MADE TO IT,
*        AS IT IS BASICALLY THE SAME.
*
***(LOGIC SUMMARY)
*
*              ***** NOT YET DEFINED *****
*
***(INSTALLATION)
*
*        1. RETRIEVE STAGE1B MEMBER FROM LIBRARYN.MVS SURROUNDING
*              IT WITH LIBRARYN-INTRDR JCL.
*        2. MODIFY STAGE1B AND RETURN TO LIBRARYN.MVS WITH AN EXEC
*              SO 'IPO1.IOGEN.STAGE1B' IS REPLACED.
*        3. MVS COMMAND 'S IPORDR,M=M11IPO2' TO RUN STAGE1.
*        4. CHECK FOR ANY ERRORS AND DO STEPS 2 AND 3 AGAIN IF NECESSARY.
*        5. RETRIEVE STAG2SEL MEMBER FROM LIBRARYN.MVS .
*        6. MODIFY STAG2SEL SO THAT IT DOES A TEMP UPDATE ON MEMBER
*              STAGE2 CREATED BY THE STAGE1 JOB. ALL JOB CARDS SHOULD
*              BE REPLACED WITH ONES CONFORMING TO MONSANTO BXL STANDARDS
*              AND JOBS 2 AND 4 CAN NORMALLY BE DELETED AS THEY REPLACE
*              LIKE MEMBERS IN THE EXISTING SYSTEM.
*        7. JUST BEFORE YOU ARE READY TO RUN THE STAGE2, ISSUE THE MVS
*              COMMAND 'S IPORDR,M=M11IPO1'. THIS COPIES THE EXISTING
*              SYSTEM TO A NEW DISK PACK NAMED TARGET.
*              NOTE: NO UPDATES TO IPOR01 SHOULD BE DONE FROM THIS TIME
*              UNTIL THE STAGE2 HAS FINISHED. THEY WOULD BE LOST.
*        8. REPLACE STAG2SEL ON LIBRARYN.MVS PUTTING THE JOBSTREAM
*              ON THE INTERNAL READER. STAG2SEL WILL IN TURN PUT THE
*              SELECTED STAGE2 JOBS ON THE INTERNAL READER.
*              THIS REPLACES THE 'S IPORDR,DSNAME=IPO1.IOGEN.STAGE2' IN
*              THE STANDARD PROCEDURE.
*        9. RELEASE JOB5 WHEN THE OTHER JOBS HAVE FINISHED.
*        10. COMMAND 'S IPORDR,M=M11IPO4' TO RENAME THE TARGET BACK
*              TO IPOR01.
*        11. DISMOUNT THE OLD IPOR01 AND MOUNT THE NEW.
*        12. IPL WITH 'CLPA' IN THE SYSTEM INITIALISATION PARAMETERS.
*        13. KEEP THE OLD IPOR01 AS A SECURITY.
*        14. RECORD THE FACT OF THE IOGEN IN THE COMMUNICATIONS LOG.
*        15. TO TEST THE SYSTEM AND UPDATE SMP, ISSUE COMMAND
*              'S IPORDR,M=IPOIVP'.
*
***(TESTING)
*
*        SEE STEP 15 ABOVE.
*        RUN THE SYSTEM AND WAIT FOR IT TO BREAK.
