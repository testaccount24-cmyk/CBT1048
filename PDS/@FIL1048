//***FILE1048 was sent in by David Cartwright and contains an       *   FILE1048
//*           enormous amount of material that is known by the      *   FILE1048
//*           name of Monsanto Mods, from Monsanto in Brussels,     *   FILE1048
//*           Belgium.  Most of this material is from the early     *   FILE1048
//*           to mid 1970's, but there is a lot to explore here,    *   FILE1048
//*           and it may be especially useful to those people who   *   FILE1048
//*           are running MVS 3.8 under Hercules.                   *   FILE1048
//*                                                                 *   FILE1048
//*           As prepared on this file, the material was obtained   *   FILE1048
//*           in ASCII format and converted to EBCDIC.  There is    *   FILE1048
//*           more material included here, which will be added      *   FILE1048
//*           later.  These are some C Language programs that       *   FILE1048
//*           convert between ASCII and EBCDIC.  This material was  *   FILE1048
//*           prepared on z/OS 2.5 and put into XMIT format there.  *   FILE1048
//*           the XMIT job is called MONXMIT, and the RECEIVE job   *   FILE1048
//*           is called MONRECV.                                    *   FILE1048

//*           There are three load libraries missing from this      *   FILE1048
//*           file:  JEA.LOADLIB,  BIRDS.LOADLIB, SYS1.LINKLIB2.    *   FILE1048
//*           They were included on the "tape" which David          *   FILE1048
//*           Cartwright sent me, but I could not get the data      *   FILE1048
//*           off from the tape.  (We'll keep trying.)              *   FILE1048
