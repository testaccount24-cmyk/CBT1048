$ THE RETRIEVE ROUTINE CHECKS TO SEE IF THIS MODULE HAS ALREADY BEEN RETRIEVED
  BY YOU OR SOMEONE ELSE BEFOREHAND. IF IT HAS, A WARNING MESSAGE IS GIVEN
  AND YOU WILL HAVE THE OPTION TO CONTINUE WITH THE RETRIEVE REQUEST OR
  TO ABORT IT.

  ONCE YOU HAVE RETRIEVED A MODULE, THE ENTRY FOR THAT MEMBER OF THE PARTICULAR
  LIBRARYN FILE IN QUESTION WILL BE KEPT ON THE SPF CONTROL FILE UNTIL YOU
  RETURN THE MODULE VIA THE SPF/LIBRARYN INTERFACE. ANY MODULE WHICH HAS BEEN
  RETRIEVED IN THIS WAY SHOULD THEREFORE ALWAYS BE RETURNED IN THE SAME WAY
  AND&NOT$BY A BATCH LIBRARYN.
