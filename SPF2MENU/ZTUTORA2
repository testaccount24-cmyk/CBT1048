$ A PASSWORD FOR THE MODULE IS AUTOMATICALLY GENERTED AND CAN BE EXAMINED
  ALONG WITH OTHER INDEX DATA USING&INDXLIST$( OPTION&4$).

  THE&-PGMR$ AND&-DESC$CARDS ARE BUILT FROM DATA SUPPLIED BY YOU AND THE MENU
  WILL PROMPT FOR THE REQUIRED INFORMATION.

  SHOULD YOU WISH TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIBRARYN CONTROL CARDS, THEY CAN BE
  INCLUDED AT THE FRONT OF YOUR SOURCE MODULE. YOU MAY WISH, FOR EXAMPLE TO
  SPECIFY DIFFERENT SEQUENCING FROM THE DEFAULT WHICH IS SET AUTOMATICALLY TO
  START IN COLUMN&75$AND HAVE A LENGTH OF&6$DIGITS.

  ONCE THE MODULE HAS BEEN LOADED INTO THE LIBRARYN MASTER FILE, IT WILL BE
  DELETED FROM THE SOURCE LIBRARY IF IT IS A MEMBER OF A PDS AND DELETED
  ENTIRELY IF IT IS A SEQUENTIAL DATA SET. THIS PREVENTS SOMEONE ACCIDENTLY
  CONTINUING TO UPDATE A NEW MODULE AFTER IT HAS BEEN ADDED TO LIBRARYN.
  IF YOU DO WISH TO CONTINUE TO UPDATE THE MODULE, THEN RETRIEVE IT AGAIN
  USING&RETRIEVE$( OPTION&1$).
