$ TO SELECT ANY OF THESE OPTIONS, ENTER THE APPROPRIATE CODE ON THE LIBRARYN
$ PRIMARY SELECTION MENU.

  NOTES:

 &RETRIEVE$ ALLOWS YOU TO EXTRACT ANY MODULE DIRECTLY FROM THE LIBRARYN
  MASTER ON WHICH IT RESIDES AND PLACE IT IN A SEQUENTIAL OR PARTITIONED
  DATA SET. THE ROUTINE WILL CHECK THAT THE FILE DOES NOT ALREADY CONTAIN
  DATA AND ISSUE A WARNING MESSAGE IF IT DOES.

 &REPLACE$ SHOULD BE USED ONCE THE MODULE PREVIOUSLY RETRIEVED HAS BEEN
  UPDATED AND TESTED. ONCE THE UPDATED MODULE HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY
  RELOADED INTO LIBRARYN, IT IS DELETED FROM THE SOURCE FILE TO PREVENT
  CORRUPTION. I.E. TO ENSURE NOONE UPDATES IT WITHOUT RE-RETRIEVING IT.

 &INSERT$ ADDS A NEW MODULE TO THE FILE AND CHECKS THAT NO MODULE OF THE
  SAME NAME ALREADY EXISTS. A PASSWORD IS AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED FOR THE
  NEW MODULE AND MAINTAINED BY THE ROUTINE. AGAIN THE INPUT SOURCE IS
  DELETED TO PREVENT CORRUPTION.
