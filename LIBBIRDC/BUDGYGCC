*        THE PURPOSE OF THIS SET OF BUDGIE CONTROL CARDS IS TO MAINTAIN
*         A SEQUENTIAL DATA SET CONTAINING OBJECT DECKS FOR THE VARIOUS
*         BUDGIE CSECTS, KEEPING THE MOST RECENT OBJECT DECK OF EACH.
SKIP1
*        EACH OBJECT DECK IS TREATED AS A 'BATCH', AND THE FOLLOWING
*         PROPERTIES OF AN OBJECT DECK ARE UTILISED:-
*         . COLUMNS 77-80 CONTAIN A 4-DIGIT SEQUENCE NUMBER
*         . THE 1ST ESD CARD HAS A SEQUENCE NUMBER OF '0001'
*         . THE 1ST ESD CARD COMTAINS THE CSECT NAME IN 17-24
SKIP1
*        BUDGIE1 IS USED TO SORT THE 'BATCHES' INTO ASCENDING BATCH
*         NUMBER ( I.E. CSECT NAME ) SEQUENCE.  THE SEQUENCE OF THE
*         CONCATENATED INPUT DATA SETS ( NEW DECKS FOLLOWED BY THE OLD
*         DECKS ON THE PERMANENT DATA SET ), ENSURES THAT, FOR A GIVEN
*         CSECT, THE NEW DECK OCCURS FIRST IN THE OUTPUT.
SKIP1
*        BUDGIE3 ACCEPTS THESE SORTED 'BATCHES', AND REJECTS DUPLICATE
*         'BATCH' NUMBERS.  THUS, IF A NEW DECK HAS BEEN CREATED, THEN
*         THE OLD DECK IS DISCARDED.
SKIP1
*        THIS MS02 CARD CAUSES A CARD WITH '0001' IN COLUMNS 77-80 TO
*         BE TREATED AS A BATCH CARD, AND USES COLUMNS 17-24 FOR THE
*         BATCH NUMBER.  OUTPUT RECORDS ARE 80 BYTES LONG.
