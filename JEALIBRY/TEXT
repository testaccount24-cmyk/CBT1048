- SPF WILL AUTOMATICALLY SUPPORT A FULL 24 PROGRAM FUNCTION KEYS AS WILL
BE FOUND ON THE NEW 3278 SCREENS TO BE INSTALLED IN APRIL.

- HEX DATA CAN NOW BE DISPLAYED UNDER SPF 'BROWSE' AND 'EDIT' COMMANDS
BY USING THE NEW PRIMARY COMMAND - 'HEX ON|OFF DATA|VERT'. THE DATA WILL
BE DISPLAYED IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THE CORRESPONDING HEX DIGITS WHICH CAN

OPERAND WHICH IS A HEX STRING IN THE FORM - X'NNNNN' WHERE NNNNN ARE HEX

COMMAND ALONE). ALSO CONVERTED INTO THIS NEW FORM OF LINE COMMAND ARE THE THREE
EDIT OPTIONS, (PRINT, AUTO-RENUM, AND STATS), AND THEY NO LONGER APPEAR ON THE
EDIT MENU. ALL THE VALUES THAT YOU SPECIFY FOR THESE EDIT OPTIONS WILL
AUTOMATICALLY BE SAVED IN A 'PROFILE'.

- PROFILES. UP TO 25 PROFILES ARE STORED FOR EACH SPF USER AND CONTAIN
SETTINGS FOR ALL THE PRIMARY EDIT MODES. WHEN YOU EDIT A FILE, THE
APPROPRIATE PROFILE WILL BE RETRIEVED AND THE EDIT MODES SET. THERE IS A
NEW FIELD ON THE EDIT MENU WHERE YOU CAN ENTER THE NAME OF THE PROFILE  YOU WANT
TO USE. YOU CAN CREATE AS MANY AS YOU LIKE UP TO 25. IF NO PROFILE NAME IS
SPECIFIED, THEN SPF CREATES A NAME EQUAL TO THE LAST PART (THE FILE TYPE) OF THE
DATA SET NAME YOU ARE EDITTING.

****** FEATURES SPECIFIC TO EDIT *******

FOR ANY REASON THE SYSTEM GOES DOWN, THEN SPF WILL PROMPT YOU AT THE
NEXT EDIT ONCE THE SYSTEM IS RESTORED. YOU CAN IGNORE THE RECOVERY OR
CARRY ON WITH IT AT THE POINT YOU WERE WHEN THE SYSTEM FAILED. NOTE THAT
THE MAINTENANCE OF THIS BACKUP INVOLVES A FAIRLY HIGH OVERHEAD AND WILL
SLOW DOWN THE SPF RESPONSE TIMES.

LINES CAN REPLACE BLANKS IN ANOTHER LINE OR BLOCK OF LINES. THE SOURCE
LINE/S ARE PINPOINTED WITH AN 'M', 'MM', 'C', OR 'CC' AS NORMAL FOR

COMMAND  'O' OR 'OO'.

- MOVE/COPY CAN NOW BE PERFORMED MULTIPLY BY SPECIFYING A NUMBER WITH
THE 'A' OR 'B'.
