                                       TO A GIVEN LINE OF OUTPUT.  THE
                                       NUMBER IS RIGHT JUSTIFIED AND
                                       NEED NOT BE SEQUENTIAL.  THIS

                                       CARD MUST FOLLOW A TYPE 1 CARD
                                       AND HAVE THE SAME SEQUENCE NUM-
                                       BER.  IF THERE IS NO DATA FOR A

0   5         SPACING CONTROL          THIS POSITION IS USED TO CONTROL
                                       LINE SKIPPING BEFORE PRINTING.
                                       A 1 OR A SPACE CAUSES PRINTING
                                       TO BEGIN ON THE NEXT LINE.  ANY
                                       OTHER NUMBER CAUSES THAT MANY
                                       LINES TO BE SKIPPED BEFORE
                                       PRINTING.  AN E CAUSES PRINTING
                                       TO BEGIN AT THE TOP OF A PAGE.
0   6-8       REPEAT INDICATOR         THESE COLUMNS ARE USED WHEN IT
                                       IS DESIRED TO REPEAT ONE OF THE
                                       FIRST TWENTY LINES OF PRINT.
                                       THE SEQUENCE NUMBER OF THE
                                       DESIRED LINE IS PLACED IN THESE
                                       COLUMNS.

    REST OF THE PRINT LINE IS SPECIFIED ON A TYPE 2 CARD FOLLOW-
    ING THE TYPE 1 CARD WITH AN IDENTICAL SEQUENCE NUMBER.  THE
    DATA STARTING IN COLUMN 9 WILL BE PLACED ON THE SAME PRINT
    LINE BEGINNING IN POSITION 73.
0   WHEN USING THE REPEAT INDICATOR, THE SEQUENCE NUMBER REFERRED
    TO MUST BE ONE OF THE FIRST TWENTY UNIQUE PRINT LINES SPECI-
    FIED.  A TYPE 2 CARD IS NOT NECESSARY BUT IF ANY SPACING IS
    DESIRED, COLUMN 5 MUST BE USED.  THIS ALLOWS FOR REPETITION
    OF HEADINGS AND TYPICAL REPORT LINES, WITHOUT FURNISHING A
    COMPLETE SET OF DATA FOR EACH LINE.
