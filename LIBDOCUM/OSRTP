0        O/S REMOTE TERMINAL PROGRAM - OPERATOR'S GUIDE.
-INTRODUCTION
+____________
0        OSRTP IS THE O/S REMOTE TERMINAL PROGRAM WRITTEN BY D.R.HURTGEN
         IN THE STATES IN 1970 TO ENABLE ONE COMPUTER TO 'TALK' TO
         ANOTHER COMPUTER RUNNING A HASP (NOWADAYS JES2) SYSTEM.IT SIMULATES
         A SYSTEM 360 MODEL 20 REMOTE WORKSTATION WITH TWO PRINTERS, THREE
         PUNCHES AND A CONSOLE, USING DISK FILES FOR INPUT AND TRANSFERRING
         OUTPUT TO THE EUROPEAN JES2 SYSTEM VIA JOBS ON THE INTERNAL READER.
0        THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS OF THIS PROGRAM:
         REMOTE35 FOR SMALL JOBS AND RMT109 FOR USE WHEN TRANSMITTING
         LARGE REPORTS FROM BRUSSELS TO ST.LOUIS.
0        THESE NEW VERSIONS OF THE PROGRAM INCORPORATE DETAIL CHANGES
         SUGGESTED BY OPERATIONS DEPT..THESE INCLUDE:
0          INDEPENDENT CONTROL OF INTERNAL READERS
           NO MERGE OF PRINTED OUTPUT
           ONE REPORT PER SESSION
           DEFAULT RESTART
0        BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF CHANGES ALL OPERATORS SHOULD
         READ AND THOROUGHLY LEARN THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS AND
         FOLLOW THEM TO THE LETTER - BUT I HOPE THAT YOU WILL ALL
         CONTINUE TO OFFER CRITICISMS AND SUGGEST IMPROVEMENTS.
         DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT ME IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM, EVEN
         DURING THE NIGHT.(TELEPHONE 734-8043).
0        GOOD LUCK.

1TO START
+________
0        THE PRODUCTION REMOTE35 USES THE JES2 LINE 6 (UNUSED)
         PORT (028) TO ACCESS THE ST.LOUIS LINE,SO BEFORE STARTING REMOTE35
         DRAIN LINE 6 ($PLNE6).
0        REMOTE35 RUNS AS A STARTED TASK SO AS NOT TO WASTE AN INITIATOR
         AND TO RUN OUTSIDE OF THE RESPONSE-THROUGHPUT CONTROL OF AUTOCOMM.
         THEREFORE TO START REMOTE35 YOU ONLY NEED ENTER THE COMMAND :
0                  S REMOTE35
0        NO PARAMETERS SHOULD BE ENTERED ON THE START COMMAND UNLESS
         REQUESTED BY E.BORLON OR TSG.
0         N.B. YOU WILL NORMALLY RUN 'STLJOBS' BEFORE STARTING REMOTE35
          - SEE 'INPUT' SECTION.
-        WHEN THE PROGRAM STARTS IT WILL ASK FOR RESTART INFORMATION.
         THE NORMAL REPLY AT THE START OF A NEW SESSION IS:
0                  0,A                 (ZERO,QUEUE A)
0        NOTE THAT ON THE NEW VERSION A NULL REPLY DEFAULTS TO '00,A'.
0        IF YOU ARE RESTARTING AFTER A FAILURE AND WANT TO RE-TRANSMIT
         THE LAST JOB IN PROCESS OF TRANSMISSION AT THE TIME OF THE
         FAILURE RESPOND WITH THE NUMBER AND QUEUE OF THE JOB YOU WANT
         REMOTE35 TO START TRANSMITTING.THE PROGRAM WILL START FROM THE
         BEGINNING OF THIS JOB.THERE ARE TWO QUEUES: A & B
         THE NUMBER OF THE JOB IS ITS POSITION IN THE QUEUE,NOT
         ITS ST.LOUIS JES2 JOB NUMBER.THIS INFORMATION WILL BE GIVEN
         BY THE PROGRAM ITSELF IN RESPONSE TO AN OPERATOR REPLY OF
         'ABEND' (SEE 'TO STOP' SECTION) BUT MUST BE FOUND FROM
         SYSLOG IF THE PROGRAM WAS CANCELLED.YOU MUST FIND THE MESSAGE
         'SENDING INPUT QUE A' (OR QUEUE B) AND COUNT THE MESSAGES
         FROM ST.LOUIS ABOUT JOBS ON R35.RD1.THE LAST ONE IS THE
         JOB YOU SHOULD RESTART ON,QUOTING THE RESTART INFORMATION
         OF ITS NUMBER IN THE REMOTE35 QUEUE AND THE QUEUE ('A' OR 'B')
         FROM THE LAST REMOTE35 'SENDING INPUT QUE' MESSAGE.
         IF THE PROGRAM HAS ISSUED A MESSAGE:
0                  INPUT QUE A TRANSMITTED    (OR QUE B)
0        BUT NOT STARTED TRANSMITTING AN INPUT QUE AGAIN AFTER THAT
         MESSAGE YOU MAY ASSUME THAT ALL INPUT HAS BEEN SENT AND THE
         RESTART NUMBER IS ZERO.
1        THERE ARE TWO SPECIAL CASES FOR RESTARTING THE INPUT QUEUES.
         BECAUSE THE PROGRAM HAS TO READ THROUGH THE WHOLE QUEUE TO
         REACH THE RESTART POINT THIS TAKES AS LONG AS TRANSMITTING THE
         JOBS IN THE FIRST PLACE.SHOULD YOU DECIDE THAT IT WOULD BE
         BEST TO ABANDON ANY ATTEMPT TO RESTART THE QUEUE YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.
         IF YOU REPLY '0,A' IT WILL START TO READ QUEUE 'A' AGAIN FROM
         THE BEGINNING, IF YOU REPLY '0,B' IT WILL READ QUEUE 'B' THEN
         START SENDING QUEUE 'A' AGAIN FROM THE BEGINNING.IF YOU REPLY
         WITH A RESTART NUMBER GREATER THAN THE NUMBER OF JOBS ON THE
         PARTICULAR QUEUE IT WILL READ THROUGH THE WHOLE QUEUE AND
         EVENTUALLY GIVE A MESSAGE THAT THE RESTART NUMBER IS INCORRECT
         AND BLOW UP.SO WHAT DO YOU DO?
0        A NEW RESTART OPTION HAS BEEN INCLUDED WHICH IS;
0              R NN,'MT,A'   OR   R NN,'MT,B'
0        THIS WILL PERFORM A CONTROLLED SCRATCH OF THE SPECIFIED QUEUE.
         THE PROGRAM WILL THEN GO ON TO THE OTHER QUEUE IN THE NORMAL WAY.
         NOTE THAT 'CONTROLLED' IN THIS CONTEXT DOES NOT MEAN THAT
         YOU CAN SCRATCH PART(S) OF THE QUEUE - IT IS ALL OR NOTHING.
         RATHER IT MEANS THAT THE PROGRAM HAS AN EXCLUSIVE ENQ ON THE
         DISK DATASET SO NO NEW JOBS CAN BE PUT ON THE QUEUE WHILST IT
         IS BEING SCRATCHED.THIS OPERATION IS VERY QUICK, SO MAKE
         SURE YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IT BEFORE STARTING - YOU WILL
         NOT HAVE TIME TO CHANGE YOUR MIND.
0        THE DISK DATASETS WHICH REMOTE35 USES FOR INPUT ARE ON SPOOL1.
0        THE OTHER SPECIAL CASE IS INTENDED FOR T.S.G. USE ONLY BUT MAY
         BE USEFULL IF THE MACHINE IS HEAVILY LOADED AND REMOTE35 STARTS
         TO GET SWAPPED OUT (THIS IS VERY UNLIKELY).THE OPTION HAS BEEN
         INCORPORATED TO HAVE REMOTE35 SET ITSELF NON-SWAPPABLE.THIS
         CODE HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE RESTART ERROR HANDLING CODE,
         THEREFORE TO ACTIVATE IT YOU NEED TO MAKE AN ERROR IN THE
         RESTART QUEUE SPECIFICATION E.G.
0        R NN,'99,S'
0        THE PROGRAM WILL RE-ISSUE THE REQUEST,TO WHICH YOU SHOULD
         MAKE THE REQUIRED CORRECT RESPONSE.
1RUNNING
+_______
-        WHEN COMMUNICATIONS ARE ESTABLISHED REMOTE35 WILL ISSUE A MESSAGE
0                  'WTOR FOR RJE MESSAGES'
0        TO WHICH YOU SHOULD REPLY WITH JES2 COMMANDS FOR ST.LOUIS
         INCLUDING THE DOLLAR SIGN, E.G.:
011.43.00 STC 7528 *73 WTOR FOR RJE MESSAGES
 73$DU,R35.PR1
 11.43.33           REPLY TO 73 IS ;$DU,R35.PR1
 11.43.40 STC 7528 *74 WTOR FOR RJE MESSAGES
 11.43.45 STC 7528  04.42.37 $HASP000 R35.PR1  0A4 ACTIVE (JOB 7941 BXLTSG)
                   ETC.
0        THE ST.LOUIS SYSTEM OVERWRITES THE FIRST CHARACTER OF THE
         MESSAGE WITH A DOLLAR SIGN, SO ANY CHARACTER MAY BE USED.
0        YOU MAY ALSO REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE TO STOP REMOTE35 (SEE BELOW)
         NOTE THAT ALL RESPONSES COME OUT ON YOUR OPERATOR CONSOLE WITH
         BOTH BRUSSELS AND ST.LOUIS TIMESTAMPS AND THAT ST.LOUIS MESSAGES
         CAN ONLY BE DISTINGUISHED  FROM BRUSSELS MESSAGES BY THAT TIMESTAMP.
         IN ORDER TO MINIMISE CONSOLE MESSAGES COMMANDS TO THE ST.LOUIS
         SYSTEM SHOULD BE KEPT TO A MINIMUM.
0        THE REMOTE35 PROGRAM FULLY SUPPORTS ALL THE DEVICES DEFINED ON
         THE ST.LOUIS SYSTEM FOR TERMINAL 'REMOTE35' - THAT IS,
         ONE READER, TWO PRINTERS AND THREE PUNCHES.THESE DEVICES
         MAY ALL BE IN OPERATION SIMULTANEOUSLY. NOTE THAT IF YOU
         DRAIN THE ONE CARD READER YOU WILL BE IN REAL TROUBLE, BECAUSE THE
         NEXT TIME YOU TRY TO SIGN ON THE PROGRAM WILL START TO SEND ITS
         INPUT WHICH THE ST.LOUIS SYSTEM WILL REFUSE TO ACCEPT,SO REMOTE35 WILL
         TRY AGAIN ETC., SO TYING UP THE LINE AND STOPPING YOU ENTERING A
         'START READER' COMMAND.IN THIS CASE YOU MUST TELEPHONE ST.LOUIS
         AND ASK THEM TO START THE READER ON REMOTE35.
0        NOTE THAT THE ST.LOUIS LINE IS VERY SLOW, SO THINGS TAKE A LONG TIME
         TO SEND AND RECEIVE, AS YOU ALL KNOW FROM THE DATA-100.IF YOU
         JUST SET IT UP YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LEAVE IT TO ITS OWN DEVICES,
         'LINE ERROR' MESSAGES WILL NO LONGER BE SHOWN.IF THE PROGRAM
         RECEIVES 32 CONSECUTIVE LINE ERRORS (WHICH TAKES ABOUT 3 MINUTES),
         IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY SHUT DOWN AND TELL YOU THE RESTART POINT.
         RESTART IT WITH THE APPROPRIATE JOB AND CANCEL THE INCOMPLETE
         JOB YOU WERE SENDING WHEN IT FAILED.NOTE THAT IF THE PROGRAM
         WAS RECEIVING OUTPUT FROM ST.LOUIS AT THE TIME OF THE LINE FAILURE
         THE RESTART MESSAGE WILL INCLUDE THE WORD 'OUTPUT'.UNFORTUNATELY
         IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PRINTED AND PUNCHED
         OUTPUT.RESTARTING PRINTED OUTPUT AT THE POINT OF FAILURE IS
         NO PROBLEM, A NEW JOB WILL BE CREATED ON THE INTERNAL READER
         FOR THE CONTINUED LISTING, BUT OUR USE OF THE PUNCH AS A JOB
         OR DATA STREAM MEANS THAT ALL PUNCHED OUTPUT MUST BE IN ONE STREAM.
+                                  _________________________________________
0        THEREFORE IF A BREAK DOES OCCUR ON OUTPUT YOU MUST CHECK THAT
         ALL PUNCH STREAMS ARE RESTARTED FROM THE BEGINNING AND INCOMPLETE
         PUNCHED OUTPUT JOBS ARE PURGED FROM THE BRUSSELS SYSTEM.
0        WHEN TRANSMITTING OR RECEIVING REMOTE35 WILL ISSUE A MESSAGE EVERY
         TIME IT SENDS OR RECEIVES 50 BLOCKS OF DATA.THESE MESSAGES ARE
         INTENDED ONLY TO TELL YOU THAT REMOTE35 IS STILL RUNNING AND HAVE
         NO OTHER PURPOSE - THEY ARE NOT PART OF THE RESTART PROCEDURE
         AND MAY BE IGNORED.
1TO STOP
+_______
0        THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS OF STOPPING REMOTE35.
0        A)AT THE END OF A SESSION WHEN THERE IS NO TRANSMISSION ACTIVITY
           YOU MAY REPLY TO REMOTE35:
0                  /*SIGNOFF
0          THIS WILL SEND A SIGN-OFF CARD TO ST.LOUIS TO END THE SESSION.
           HOWEVER, THE SIGN-OFF ONLY TAKES EFFECT WHEN ALL ACTIVITY HAS
           FINISHED,SO IT IS NOT ADVISABLE TO MAKE THIS REPLY UNLESS ALL
           DEVICES ARE INACTIVE BECAUSE YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO ENTER FURTHER
           COMMANDS TO REMOTE35.
0        B)IF YOU MUST SIGN-OFF IMMEDIATELY EVEN THOUGH TRANSMISSION IS IN
           PROGRESS YOU SHOULD REPLY TO REMOTE35:
0                  ABEND
0          THIS WILL CAUSE THE PROGRAM TO ISSUE A MESSAGE GIVING YOU
           DETAILS OF THE JOB NUMBER AND QUEUE CURRENTLY BEING SENT,
           YOU WILL NEED THIS INFORMATION TO RESTART.THE PROGRAM THEN
           ABENDS U0000.
0        C)IF YOU ARE IN REAL DIFFICULTIES YOU MAY CANCEL REMOTE35 WITH
           THE COMMAND:
0                  C REMOTE35,DUMP
0          THE DUMP MAY BE REQUIRED TO FIND THE RESTART INFORMATION,
           ALTHOUGH YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND THIS FROM SYSLOG.
           (ENTER W TO HAVE SYSLOG SCHEDULED FOR PRINTING)
           YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO CANCEL REMOTE35 - IF THE LINE
           GOES DOWN AND YOU DO NOT GET THE 'WTOR FOR RJE' MESSAGE BACK
           AFTER ENTERING A MESSAGE TO ST.LOUIS YOU WILL ONLY HAVE TO WAIT
           THREE MINUTES AND THE PROGRAM WILL ABEND ITSELF AFTER TAKING
           ALL NECESSARY STEPS TO TIDY UP OPERATIONS IN PROCESS.
1INPUT
+_____
0        JOBS MAY ADD INPUT FOR ST.LOUIS DIRECTLY ON THE REMOTE35 INPUT
         QUEUE.IF A JOB IS IN PROCESS OF DOING THIS WHEN YOU START REMOTE35
         YOU MAY GET A MESSAGE SAYING AN INPUT QUE IS IN USE.THE PROGRAM
         SHOULD KEEP TRYING THE QUEUES UNTIL IT FINDS ONE FREE, SO TAKE
         NO ACTION FOR THIS MESSAGE.
0        JUST IN CASE JOBS USE OLD PROCEDURES, WE WILL CONTINUE TO COLLECT
         INPUT BY THE 'STLJOBS' JOB STARTED FROM THE CONSOLE BY THE COMMAND:
0                  S  R,J=STLJOBS
         (DO NOT ENTER 'S STLJOBS' - THAT HAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EFFECT)
0        THIS WILL CREATE A TAPE SUITABLE FOR THE DATA-100 FOR BACKUP
         PURPOSES, THEN PUT THE INPUT ON THE APPROPRIATE DISK INPUT
         QUEUES.DO NOT ATTEMPT TO SIGN-ON TO ST.LOUIS ON THE DATA-100
         TO SEND THE TAPE WITHOUT E.BORLON, TSG OR BOB KNIGHT GIVING
         PERMISSION BECAUSE THE DATA-100 CAN NO LONGER BE SWITCHED
         TO THE ST.LOUIS LINE.THE T-BAR SWITCH FOR ST.LOUIS OR LOCAL
         OPERATION IS NOW DISCONNECTED AND MAY BE LEFT SWITCHED TO
         ST.LOUIS, THE DATA-100 IS PERMANENTLY CONNECTED TO LINE 14.
0        WHEN THERE IS A LARGE VOLUME OF DATA TO TRANSMIT, AS IS THE
         CASE WITH THE 'E' AND 'F' REPORTS, STLJOBS WILL PUT THAT INPUT
         ONTO THE QUEUE FOR RMT109 AND WILL TELL YOU TO START RMT109.
         WE HAVE DONE THIS BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS OF TYING UP THE LINE
         FOR LONG PERIODS - IT IS BETTER TO HAVE A SEPARATE TERMINAL FOR
         THESE JOBS.YOU CAN START REMOTE35, SEND ALL THE SMALL JOBS,
         THEN SIGNOFF AND START RMT109 TO SEND ALL THE BIG JOBS.
         NOTE THAT YOU CANNOT USE REMOTE35 AND RMT109 TOGETHER AS THEY BOTH
         USE THE SAME LINE.
0        THERE MAY BE A DELAY OF 2 - 3 MINUTES BETWEEN STLJOBS ENDING
         AND REMOTE35 STARTING TO SEND THE INPUT - THIS IS NORMAL AS THE
         PROGRAM IS NOT LOOKING AT THE QUEUES ALL THE TIME.THE ONLY
         WAY TO ENSURE IMMEDIATE TRANSMISSION IS TO STOP REMOTE35 AND
         RESTART IT - NOT RECOMMENDED.
0        STLJOBS MAY BE RUN BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER AN REMOTE35 SESSION.
         THE SYSTEM WILL LOOK AFTER ITS QUEUES ITSELF, ALTHOUGH THIS
         MAY MEAN THAT TASKS ARE SWAPPED OUT FOR LONG PERIODS WAITING
         FOR ANOTHER TASK TO FINISH WITH THE QUEUES.IN NORMAL OPERATION
         YOU SHOULD RUN STLJOBS THEN WHEN IT HAS ENDED START REMOTE35.IF YOU
         WANT TO SEND MORE INPUT YOU CAN RUN STLJOBS AGAIN WITHOUT STOPPING
         REMOTE35.
1        IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A LIST OF JOBS AWAITING TRANSMISSION YOU MAY
         LIST THE INPUT QUEUES ON DISK WITH THE PROCEDURE 'STLLIST'.
         ENTER :
0              S STLLIST
0        THE FIRST REPORT IS FOR QUEUE 'A', THE SECOND FOR QUEUE 'B'.
         THESE REPORTS ARE ALSO PRINTED AT THE END OF 'STLJOBS'.
0        YOU MAY NOTICE THAT THERE IS NO REAL, PHYSICAL CARD READER ATTACHED
         TO REMOTE35, SO THE PROBLEM ARISES - WHAT ABOUT INPUT JOBS ON CARD?
         THESE MUST OBVIOUSLY BE TRANSFERED TO THE REMOTE35 INPUT FILE ON DISK
         AND THE WAY TO DO IT IS TO PUT THE ENTIRE JOB AS INPUT TO A JOB WHICH
         YOU RUN.THE JCL REQUIRED IS;
0        // --------- JOB ---------------------  (A NORMAL BRUSSELS JOB CARD)
         //STEP1  EXEC  STLJOBS
         //SYSUT1  DD  DATA,DLM='%%'
                   ST.LOUIS JOB GOES HERE
         %%                                      (DELIMITER)
0        YOU SEE THAT THE PROCEDURE (CALLED FROM SYS1.PROCLIB) HAS THE SAME
         NAME (STLJOBS) AS THE JOB YOU START TO CREATE THE DATA-100 TAPE
         (FROM HASP.JCLLIB) - CONFUSING, ISN'T IT?
1RMT109
+______
0        WE HAVE HAD ST.LOUIS DEFINE A SECOND TERMINAL FOR US.THIS IS CALLED
0              RMT109
0        IT HAS ONE READER, ONE PRINTER AND ONE PUNCH.IT ALSO OPERATES
         WITH LARGER (808 BYTE) BUFFERS.WE HAVE GENERATED A VERSION OF THE
         OSRTP TO USE THIS TERMINAL NAME AND HAVE MODIFIED 'STLJOBS'
         TO DETECT LARGE INPUT VOLUMES AND DIRECT THOSE JOBS TO RMT109.
         THIS WILL NORMALLY ONLY BE REQUIRED AT MONTH-END WHEN WE HAVE TO
         SEND THE 'E' AND 'F' REPORTS.STLJOBS WILL ISSUE A MESSAGE
         TO TELL YOU THAT RMT109 IS REQUIRED.
0        OPERATING RMT109 IS VERY SIMILAR TO REMOTE35.YOU START IT BY:
0              S RMT109
0        THE MESSAGE ABOUT RESTART QUEUES IS THE SAME,YOU NORMALLY REPLY;
0              0,A
0        ALL OTHER INSTRUCTIONS ARE THE SAME, EXCEPT OF COURSE THAT
         YOUR COMMANDS TO THE ST.LOUIS SYSTEM REFER TO RMT109. E.G.:
0              R NN,'$DN,R=R109'
0        THIS PROCEDURE USES THE SAME LINE AS REMOTE35,SO YOU CANNOT
         RUN THE TWO TOGETHER.RMT109 IS ONLY USED FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF
         INPUT, HENCE IT WILL NORMALLY RUN FOR A LONG TIME (6 HOURS +)
         THEREFORE YOU SHOULD RUN REMOTE35 FIRST TO SEND ANY SMALL JOBS,
         SIGNOFF (YOU MAY HAVE TO DRAIN THE PRINTERS TO STOP ACTIVITY)
         AND THEN START RMT109.
         BECAUSE RMT109 HAS LARGER BUFFERS THE 'BXL BLOCKS=' MESSAGES
         TAKE A LONGER TIME TO APPEAR.THIS TERMINAL IS IN FACT VERY
         SLIGHTLY FASTER THEN REMOTE35 (BECAUSE OF THE BIGGER BUFFERS),
         BUT APPEARS TO BE SLOWER BECAUSE ONE OF ITS BLOCKS TAKES TWICE
         AS LONG TO SEND DOWN THE LINE - THE BLOCKS CONTAIN TWICE AS MUCH
         DATA, SO THIS IS NORMAL.
0        THERE SHOULD NOT NORMALLY BE ANY OUTPUT FROM RMT109.IF THERE IS
         THEN IT WILL BE PUT ON OUR SPOOL VIA THE INTERNAL READER THE SAME
         AS REMOTE35.NOTE THAT RECEIVING OUTPUT SLOWS DOWN SENDING INPUT,
         SO YOU SHOULD NOT NORMALLY PERFORM THESE TWO FUNCTIONS TOGETHER
         ON RMT109.AS REMOTE35 IS USED FOR SMALL JOBS THIS DOES NOT MATTER FOR
         REMOTE35 AND YOU NORMALLY SHOULD ALLOW INPUT AND OUTPUT TO BE
         PERFORMED SIMULTANEOUSLY IN ORDER TO GET THE BEST TURNAROUND.
1OUTPUT
+______
0        THE NEW VERSION OF THE OSRTP CALLED 'REMOTE35' WILL PUT THE OUTPUT
         STRAIGHT OUT TO THE INTERNAL READER INSTEAD OF GOING ON TO DISK TO
         BE PROCESSED BY A SEPARATE PROGRAM AFTERWARDS.THERE IS ONE INTERNAL
         READER ALLOCATED TO EACH DEVICE,SO YOU MAY HAVE SEVERAL JOBS
         GOING TO THE INTERNAL READER AT THE SAME TIME.EACH INTERNAL READER
         IS CONTROLLED INDEPENDENTLY OF THE OTHERS, SO IT IS NO LONGER
         NECESSARY TO WAIT FOR ALL DEVICES TO END BEFORE OUTPUT IS AVAILABLE
         TO THE USER.
0        THIS AUTOMATIC OUTPUT FACILITY MEANS THAT ONCE REMOTE35 HAS BEEN
         SETUP YOU CAN LEAVE IT TO TRANSMIT JOBS AND TAKE OFF OUTPUT
         WITH NO OPERATOR INTERVENTION - THE ONLY TIME YOU WILL NEED TO
         ALTER THE DEVICE SETTINGS IS FOR SPECIAL FORMS (MAINLY PERSONNEL
         JOBS FOR MIKE SALMON WHICH SHOULD BE PROCESSED UNDER HIS SUPERVISION).
         THE TERMINAL SHOULD BE SETUP AS FOLLOWS:
0              R35.PR1             STD. FORMS
               R35.PR2             3535 FORMS
               R35.PU1             STD. FORMS
               R35.PU2             3535 FORMS
               R35.PU3             DRAINED.
0        IT IS POSSIBLE TO SET (FOR EXAMPLE) BOTH PRINTERS TO FORMS 3535.
         YOU WILL THEN GET TWO JOBS RECEIVED AT THE SAME TIME.HOWEVER,
         THE TOTAL TIME TAKEN TO RECEIVE ALL THE OUTPUT WILL NOT BE
+            _____ ____
         VERY MUCH DIFFERENT TO THE TIME TAKEN TO RECEIVE THE JOBS ONE BY
         ONE BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE TO SEND THE SAME NUMBER OF CHARACTERS
         OVER THE LINE, AND IT IS THE SPEED OF THE LINE WHICH LIMITS
         THE RATE OF DATA TRANSFER (YOU DO GET A VERY SMALL BENEFIT BECAUSE
         THE ST.LOUIS JES2 SYSTEM WILL RESPOND FASTER, BUT IT IS VERY SMALL).
         YOU CAN SEE THIS FOR YOURSELF BY TIMING THE INTERVAL TAKEN
         BETWEEN THE MESSAGES FOR FIFTY BLOCKS FROM ST.LOUIS.
         THE MOST LIKELY CONSEQUENCE IS THAT YOU WILL CONFUSE THE NEXT
         SHIFT, SO YOU SHOULD NOT ALTER THE DEVICE SETTINGS LAID OUT ABOVE
         EXCEPT FOR SPECIAL FORMS.
0        ALL OUTPUT RESTART CAPABILITIES TRIED ON TEST VERSIONS OF OSRTP
         HAVE BEEN ABANDONED BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO CONFUSING.NOW EVERY STREAM
         OF OUTPUT WILL BE PUT ON THE INTERNAL READER AS A SEPARATE
         JOB - IF THE LINE GOES DOWN YOU SHOULD FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES
         YOU USED ON THE DATA-100 TO REPEAT THE OUTPUT IN ORDER TO
         RECEIVE PUNCHED OUTPUT AS ONE COMPLETE STREAM. PURGE FROM THE
         EUROPEAN SYSTEM ANY INCOMPLETE JOBS DEALING WITH PUNCHED OUTPUT.
         PRINTED OUTPUT IS NOT SO CRITICAL AND MAY BE LEFT IN TWO (OR MORE)
         PARTS, ALTHOUGHT IF THE STREAM GETS TOO FRAGMENTED YOU MAY WANT
         TO RESTART IT FROM THE BEGINNING.
0        THE REPORT OF OUTPUT RECEIVED IS PRODUCED BY REMOTE35 WHEN
         IT IS TERMINATED - FILE THIS IN THE NORMAL WAY.THERE SHOULD BE
         ONE PAGE FOR THE TOTAL SESSION INSTEAD OF ONE PAGE PER OUTPUT
         SESSION GENERATED BY PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THE PROGRAM.
