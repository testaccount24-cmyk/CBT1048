01. PURPOSE
 ----------
0   WHEN TESTING PROGRAM THIS UTILITY GIVES THE ABILITY
    TO SELECT FROM A PRODUCTION FILE A LIMITED SUB-SET
    AND CREATE A TEST-DATA FILE.  THE UNIQUE FEATURE
    OF TWAT IS THAT IT CAN SELECT EVERY NTH RECORD AND
    PUT A LIMIT ON THE SIZE OF THE TEST FILE.
02. LIMITATIONS
 --------------
0   SELECTION IS ONLY BASED ON EXTERNAL COUNTERS, TO
    SELECT RECORDS BASED ON THEIR INTERNAL CONTENT USE
    UT414.
03. INPUT DATA
 -------------
0   A.   CONTROL DATA.
0        THIS IS ENTERED THROUGH THE PARAMETER FIELD OF
         THE EXEC CARD.  THE ALLOWABLE PARAMETERS ARE
         POSITIONAL AND MUST APPEAR IN THE FOLLOWING
         SEQUENCE, THE VOLUME OF EACH CAN BE 1 TO 99999
         INCLUSIVE.
0        //  EXEC PGM=TWAT,PARM=(A,B,C)
0   WHERE     A GIVES THE VALUE TO SELECT EVERY ATH RECORD,
              B IS THE NUMBER OF RECORDS TO BE SELECTED, AND
              C IS THE NUMBER OF THE FIRST RECORD TO BE
                                                 SELECTED.
0   THE NORMAL RULES FOR FORMATTING THE PARAMETERS MUST BE
    FOLLOWED.  OMITTED PARAMETERS WILL TAKE THE DEFAULT
    OPTIONS A = 1, B = 100, C = 1, I.E. BY DEFAULT THE
    PROGRAM WILL SELECT THE FIRST 100 RECORDS.  INVALID
    OR IMPROPERLY FORMATTED PARAMETERS WILL CAUSE AN
    ABNORMAL END TO BE TAKEN, WITH A CONDITION CODE OF 16.

03. CONTD/...
0   B.   THE INPUT FILE.
0        THIS WILL HAVE THE DDNAME SYSUT1 AND CAN BE ANY
         SEQUENTIAL DATA SET.
04. OUTPUT DATA
 --------------
0   THERE ARE TWO OUTPUT FILES -
0   A.   THE CREATED DATA-SET.
0        THIS HAS DDNAME SYSUT2 AND CONSISTS OF THE
         SEQUENTIAL FILE SELECTED FROM THE INPUT FILE.
0   B.   THE PRINT DATA-SET.
0        THIS HAS DDNAME = SYSPRINT AND IS A LISTING OF
         THE NUMBER OF GENERATED RECORDS IN OUTPUT FILE.
05. OPERATIONS
 -------------
0   THE PROGRAM IS RESIDENT ON SYS2.LINKLIB AND THE FOLLOWING
    JCL IS NEEDED TO EXECUTE IT.
0   //JOB1    JOB (9999,0001), YOURNAME,CLASS=T
    //STEP    EXEC PGM=TWAT,PARM=(A,B,C)
    //SYSPRINT  DD  SYSOUT=A
    //SYSUT1    DD  DSNAME=ANYFILE,DISP=SHR
    //SYSUT2    DD  DSNAME=NEWFILE,DISP=(,CATLG),
    //          DATA SET ATTRIBUTES
06. EXAMPLES OF PARAMETERS
 -------------------------
0   TO SELECT THE FIRST 100 RECORDS ONLY.
0   //STEP    EXEC  PGM=TWAT
    TO SELECT EVERY OTHER RECORD AND SELECT EXACTLY 100
    //STEP  EXEC PGM=TWAT,PARM=2
    TO SELECT EVERY 10TH RECORD, STARTING FROM THE 1,234TH
    AND LIMITING SELECTION TO 55 RECORDS
    //STEP  EXEC  PGM=TWAT,PARM=(10,55,1234)

06. EXAMPLES OF PARAMETERS  CONTD/...
 -------------------------
0   TO OMIT FROM THE SELECTION THE FIRST 5,000 RECORDS OF
    A FILE OF APPROXIMATELY 7,500 RECORDS.
    //STEP  EXEC  PGM=TWAT,PARM=(,5000,5001)
0   SECOND PARAMETER IS AN ARBRITARY HIGH NUMBER.
