01. PURPOSE
 ----------
0   TO PROVIDE A SIMPLE MEANS OF PRINTING OR PUNCHING, IN
    COLLATING SEQUENCE, MEMBERS OF A PARTITIONED DATASET
    IN IEBPTPCH FORMAT.
02. LIMITATIONS
 --------------
0   1.   CONTROL CARD CHECKING IS LIMITED TO THE OPERATION
         FIELD : ANY OTHER ERRORS WILL CAUSE UNPREDICTABLE
         RESULTS.
0   2.   A MAXIMUM OF FORTY GROUP NAMES ARE PERMITTED PER
         EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAM.
0   3.   THE WORD ALL MAY NOT BE USED AS A KEYWORD TO
         SELECT MEMBERS.
03. INPUT
 --------
0   1.   DDNAME SYSUT1.  ANY PARTITIONED DATASET CONTAINING
         RECORDS WITH PRINTABLE CHARACTERS.
0   2.   DDNAME SYSIN.  CONTROL CARD DATASET.  CONTROL
         CARDS SHOULD CONFORM TO THE NORMAL STANDARDS
         USED BY IBM UTILITIES.
04. OUTPUT
 ---------
0   1.   DDNAME SYSPRINT.  IEBPTPCH MESSAGE DATASET.
0   2.   DDNAME SYSUT2.  EITHER A LISTING (OR CARD IMAGES)
         OF MEMBERS SELECTED.  AGAIN THIS IS THE OUTPUT
         DATASET OF IEBPTPCH.

05. OPERATION
 ------------
0   THIS PROGRAM WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE IEBPTPCH
    UTILITY.  A CONTROL DATASET IS CONSTRUCTED FROM
    DEFAULTS IN UT445 AND CARDS SUBMITTED BY THE USER.
    UT445 THEN PASSES CONTROL TO IEBPTPCH.
0   CONTROL CARDS                                (MANDATORY)
    -------------
         GROUP     NAME=AAAAAA,RKP=N
    AAAAAA IS A 1 TO 6 DIGIT KEYWORD THAT DESCRIBES THE
    COMMON ELEMENT IN THE MEMBERNAMES TO BE SELECTED.
    N IS A NUMBER BETWEEN 0 AND 7 THAT INDICATES THE
    STARTING POSITION OF THE KEYWORD RELATIVE TO THE
    START OF THE MEMBERNAMES.
0   IF THE KEYWORD IS ALSO THE START OF MEMBERNAMES, THE
    RELATIVE POSITION IS ZERO (RKP=0).  THIS IS A DEFAULT
    AND NEED NOT BE CODED.
0   GROUP     NAME=ALL                           (OPTIONAL)
    CODED AS SHOWN.  A COMPLETE LISTING OF ALL THE MEMBERS
    IN A PDS WILL BE PRODUCED.
0   PRINT OR PUNCH                               (OPTIONAL)
0   RECORD
0   TITLE
0   THESE ARE ALL IEBPTPCH CONTROL CARDS AND HAVE DEFAULTS
    IN THE PROGRAM SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION.
    THEY MAY BE USED TO OVER-RIDE THE PROGRAM DEFAULTS,
    BUT IN THIS CASE THEY MUST BE CODED IN THE CORRECT
    IEBPTPCH FORMAT.  IF MORE THAN ONE OF EACH TYPE IS
    PRESENT, ONLY THE LAST ONE ENCOUNTERED WILL BE USED.

0   PRINT
         DEFAULT : PRINT TYPORG=PO,MAXNAME=400,MAXFLDS=400
0   PUNCH
         NO DEFAULT, BUT IF PRESENT WILL OVERRIDE THE PRINT
         CONTROL CARD.  TITLES AND RECORD STATEMENTS WILL BE
         SUPPRESSED.
0   RECORD
         DEFAULT : RECORD FIELD=(80,,,20)
0   TITLE
         IF PRESENT, IT WILL CREATE A SUB-TITLE.  THE MAIN
         TITLE CONTAINS THE DATASET NAME AND THE DATE.

0   ALL ANALYSTS
0   THE  FOLLOWING CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO UT445 :
0   1)   IT IS NO LONGER NECESSARY TO PUNCH GROUP NAME=ALL
         TO GET A COMPLETE LISTING OF A PARTITIONED DATASET,
         ALL WILL SUFFICE.
0   2)   A LISTING IS NOW PRODUCED SHOWING, CONTROL CARDS
         SUBMITTED FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAM AND
         ERROR MESSAGES.
0   3)   THE RESTRICTION OF SIX CHARACTERS FOR EACH NAME IS
         NOW REMOVED. THE MAXIMUM OF EIGHT CHARACTERS MAY
         NOW BE USED.
0   4)   SELECTION OF MEMBERS MAY NOW BE MADE IN IEBPTPCH
         FORMAT.
         I.E. - MEMBER NAME=XXXXXXXX.
0   5)   IF THE PROGRAM FAILS TO SELECT ANY MEMBERS FOR
         LISTING, A RETURN CODE OF EIGHT IS PASSED FOR CHECK-
         ING BY SUBSEQUENT STEPS.

0   UT445 HAS BEEN CHANGED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN
    A REQUEST FOR ONE MEMBER, AND A REQUEST FOR
    A GROUP OF MEMBERS.
0   THUS, AS FROM 08.30 HOURS ON FEBRUARY 13, 1974
    TO SELECT A SINGLE MEMBER CODE :
0   MEMBER NAME=XXXXXXXX

0   RKP MAY BE CODED WITH A MEMBER CARD BUT WILL HAVE
