01. PURPOSE
 ----------
0   THIS SUBROUTINE SHIFTS A SINGLE OR DOUBLE WORD, LEFT OR
    RIGHT, ANY NUMBER OF POSITIONS. SHIFTING IS LOGICAL
    RATHER THAN ALGEBRAIC.
02. LIMITATIONS
 --------------
0   NONE - EXCEPT AS IMPLIED BY THE SHIFTING OPERATION.
03. ARGUMENTS
 ------------
0   THERE ARE TWO ENTRY POINTS TO THIS SUBROUTINE - UT382
    AND BSHIFT. A CALL FOR UT382 REQUIRES THE USER TO PASS
    FOUR ARGUMENTS AND A CALL FOR BSHIFT REQUIRES ONLY THREE
    ARGUMENTS. THE NATURE AND FORMAT OF THESE ARGUMENTS FOLLOWS:
0   ARGUMENT       DESCRIPTION
    --------       -----------
      # 1          THE ADDRESS OF THE WORD OR WORDS TO BE SHIFTED.
0     # 2          THE ADDRESS OF A SIGNED NUMBER THAT SPECIFIES
                   THE NUMBER OF BITS TO BE SHIFTED.  NUMBER
                   SHOULD BE POSITIVE IF A RIGHT SHIFT IS DESIRED
                   AND NEGATIVE IF A LEFT SHIFT IS DESIRED.
0     # 3          THE ADDRESS WHERE THE USER DESIRES THE RESULT
                   TO BE STORED.
0     # 4          THE ADDRESS OF A NUMBER WITH A VALUE OF ONE
                   OR TWO.  A ONE INDICATES SINGLE SHIFT IS
                   DESIRED AND A TWO INDICATES DOUBLE SHIFT IS
                   DESIRED.  THIS ARGUMENT SHOULD BE OMITTED IF
                   CALL IS FOR BSHIFT.  (BSHIFT WILL AUTOMATICALLY
                   RESULT IN A SINGLE SHIFT.)
0   ALL ADDRESSES DESCRIBED ABOVE SHOULD BE ON FULL WORD
    BOUNDARIES AND ARGUMENTS 2 AND 4 SHOULD BE FULL WORD
    BINARY NUMBERS.  NO EDITING OF ARGUMENTS WILL BE PER-
    FORMED.
04. OPERATION
 ------------
0   THE USER SHOULD LINK WITH THIS SUBROUTINE BY USE OF THE
    CALL STATEMENT.  THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE CALL STATEMENT
    FORMATS; DESCRIBED BELOW.
0      1)  CALL UT382(A,B,C,D)  FOUR ARGUMENTS
0      2)  CALL BSHIFT(A,B,C)   THREE ARGUMENTS
