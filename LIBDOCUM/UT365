01. PURPOSE
 ----------
0   THE PROGRAM GENERATES PSEUDO-RANDOM NUMBERS USING THE POWER
    RESIDUE METHOD.  THE TWO SEPARATELY CALLABLE SUBROUTINES WHICH
    MAKE UP THIS PROGRAM ARE RANDOM AND FPRNDM.  SUBROUTINE
    RANDOM RETURNS VALUES IN INTEGER BINARY FORM AND FPRNDM IN
    NORMALIZED FLOATING-POINT FORM.  THE ALGORITHM USED IS:
0             RN+1 = (21B + 3) * RN MODULO 231
02. LIMITATIONS
 --------------
0        1.   THE CYCLE LENGTH OF BOTH SUBROUTINES IS 229.
0        2.   THE RANGE OF VALUES PROVIDED IN RANDOM IS 0 < N < 231.
              IN FPRNDM IT IS 0 < N < 1.
                                -
0        3.   THE NUMBER OF UNIQUE VALUES RETURNED IN RANDOM IS 229
              AND IN FPRNDM, 221.  THE REDUCTION IN FPRNDM IS DUE
              TO THE FLOAT OPERATION.

05. OPERATION
 ------------
0   THE CALLING SEQUENCE IS:
0   COBOL          ENTER LINKAGE.
                   CALL 'RANDOM' USING NAME.
                            OR
0                  CALL 'FPRNDM' USING NAME.
                   ENTER COBOL.

0   FORTRAN   CALL RANDOM (NAME).
                     OR
              CALL FPRNDM (NAME).
0   THE PARAMETER, NAME, IS THE USER ASSIGNED NAME OF THE AREA
    INTO WHICH THE RANDOM NUMBER IS TO BE PLACED.  THIS AREA
    MUST BE PROPERLY DEFINED AS TO THE TYPE OF RESULT THE
    SUBROUTINE RETURNS; E. G. INTEGER BINARY FOR RANDOM AND
    FLOATING-POINT (SINGLE PRECISION) FOR FPRNDM.
0   THE USER MAY CAUSE THE SELECTED SUBROUTINE TO RESTART ITS
    CYCLE AT ANY TIME BY PLACING ANY NEGATIVE VALUE IN AREA NAME
    PRIOR TO ENTERING IT.
