01. PURPOSE
 ----------
0   TAPES IN A GENERATION DATA GROUP ARE NORMALLY ROTATED IN THEIR SON-
    FATHER-GRANDFATHER RELATIONSHIP BY MEANS OF JOB CONTROL LANGUAGE STATE-
    MENTS OF THE FORM
    //DUMMY   DD         DSN=SYS1.TAPE(-2),DISP=OLD
    //NEWTAPE DD         DSN=SYS1.TAPE(+1),DISP=(,CATLG),
    //        VOL=REF=*.DUMMY
0   HOWEVER, THIS TECHNIQUE IS ONLY APPLICABLE TO SINGLE VOLUME GENERATION
    DATA GROUPS, BECAUSE FOR MULTI-VOLUME GENERATION DATA GROUPS ON TAPE
    THIS METHOD CAUSES THE MOUNTING OF ONLY THE LAST TAPE THAT IS CATALOGUED
    AS CONTAINING THE OLDEST GENERATION DATA GROUP MEMBER.
0   UT418 COPIES ALL THE VOLUME SERIAL NUMBERS OF THE OLDEST MEMBER OF THE
    GENERATION DATA GROUP TO THE NEW MEMBER.  AT COMPLETION OF THE JOB
    STEP THE NEW MEMBER WILL BE CATALOGUED, AND CAN BE USED IN LATER JOB
    STEPS AS
                 DSN=SYS1.TAPE(+1),DISP=OLD
    OR IN LATER JOBS AS
                 DSN=SYS1.TAPE(0),DISP=OLD
