01. PURPOSE :
 ----------
0   (1)  CREATE A DUPLICATE OF AN INPUT DATA SET FOR SECU-
         RITY.
0   (2)  BROADCAST AN INPUT DATA SET TO AS MANY AS EIGHT
         OUTPUT DATA SETS.
0   (3)  COMBINE INTO A SINGLE OUTPUT DATA SET, TWO OR MORE
         DATA SETS OF LIKE DCB CHARACTERISTICS, BUT RESI-
         DING ON DEVICES TYPES OF UNLIKE ATTRIBUTES.
0   (4)  PRODUCE ONE OR MORE EMPTY OUTPUT DATA SETS IN ONE
         EXECUTION FOR SUBSEQUENT MODDING.
0   (5)  READ-ONLY OF AN INPUT DATA SET TO VERIFY THE NUMBER
         OF RECORDS, OR JUST THAT IT IS READABLE.
02. LIMITATIONS :
 --------------
0   (1)  ONLY FIXED AND UNDEFINED RECORDS ARE CATERED FOR.
         USE OF THIS PROGRAM TO PROCESS VARIABLE LENGTH
         RECORDS WILL HAVE UNPREDICTIBLE RESULTS.
0   (2)  WHEN LOGICAL RECORDS ARE EXTENDED, THE LENGTHENED
         PART OF THE RECORD COULD CONTAIN ANY CHARACTERS.
0   (3)  COUNTS ARE LIMITED TO 9,999,999 RECORDS.
0   (4)  OUTPUT DATA SETS MUST START WITH THE DDNAME SYSUT2
         AND PROGRESS CONTIGUOUSLY.

0   3)   INPUT :
         -----
         THE INPUT DATA SET MAY BE ON TAPE, DISK, CARDS OR ANY
         DEVICE SUPPORTED BY QSAM.  IF STANDARD LABELS ARE
         PROVIDED, THERE IS NO NEED TO SPECIFY DCB PARAMETERS.
         TWO OR MORE DATA SETS MAY BE COMBINED BY CONCATENATION,
         AND MAY BE ON UNLIKE DEVICE TYPES IF SO REQUESTED IN
         THE EXEC CARD.  NORMAL RULES OF CONCATENATION APPLY.
         NOT USED FOR THE "EMPTY" MODE OF OPERATION.
0   4)   OUTPUT :
         ------
0        (1)  A COPY OR COPIES OF THE INPUT DATA SET.  UP TO EIGHT
         MAY BE SPECIFIED.  OUTPUT MAY BE ON ANY DEVICE TYPE
         SUPPORTED BY QSAM.  DCB PARAMETERS NEED NOT BE QUOTED
         IF THEY ARE THE SAME AS FOR THE INPUT DATA SET.  FOR
         EMPTY OUTPUT DATA SETS, DCB PARAMETERS MUST ALWAYS BE
         SPECIFIED.
0        LOGICAL RECORD LENGTHS MAY BE GREATER OR SMALLER THAN
         INPUT.
         NOT USED FOR THE "COUNT" MODE OF OPERATION
0   (2)  A MESSAGE DATA SET CONTAINING THE FOLLOWING, WHERE
         APPLICABLE :
0             -A TITLE IF SPECIFIED ;
              -MODE OF OPERATION ;
              -DCB PARAMETERS OF THE INPUT DATA SET ;
              -LOGICAL RECORD COUNT ;
              -NUMBER OF OUTPUT DATA SETS ;
              -RETURN OR ABEND CODE ;
              -CHECK COUNT TO BE COMPARED AGAINST, IF SPECIFIED.

0   5)   OPERATION :
         ---------
         UT432 IS CONTROLLED BY PARAMETERS IN THE EXEC CARD
         AND THE DD STATEMENTS SUPPLIED FOR THE STEP.
         THERE ARE THREE VALID MODES OF OPERATION, AS FOLLOWS :
0        (1)  COPY - OUTPUT DATA SET(S) DUPLICATE OF INPUT.
0        (2)  EMPTY - NO INPUT DATA SET, SO EMPTY OUTPUT DATA
              SETS CREATED.
0        (3)  COUNT - READ ONLY.  NO OUTPUT DATA SET.
0        AN INVALID MODE OF OPERATION IS "NO-OP" WHEN NO INPUTS
         OR OUTPUTS ARE SPECIFIED.  THIS WILL ALWAYS RESULT IN
         AN ABEND U0432 OR RC16.
0        EXEC PARAMETERS :
         ---------------
         EACH PARAMETER HAS A SHORT AND A LONG FORM.  THEY ARE
         AS FOLLOWS :
0        (1)  UNLIKE - INDICATES THAT CONCATENATED INPUT IS PRESENT
              OR
                        AND DIFFERENT DEVICE TYPES ARE USED.  DO NOT
              UL
                        CODE FOR CONCATENATED INPUT ON LIKE DEVICE
                        TYPES.
0        (2)  NODUMP - IF CODED, WILL PREVENT THE PROGRAM ABENDING
              OR
                        WITH U0432 IN THE EVENT OF A "BADEND" OF THE
              ND
                        PROGRAM.  INSTEAD, A RETURN CODE OF 16 WILL
                        BE PASSED BACK TO O.S.
1************
 * UT432    *
 ************
0   (3)  COUNT - MAY BE USED TO TEST THE LOGICAL RECORD COUNT
         OR
                   OF THE DATA SET TO BE PROCESSED.  IF THE
         C
                   TEST IS NOT SATISFIED, THE PROGRAM GOES TO
                   BADEND.  THE OPERATORS ARE :
                   COUNT>NNN - COUNT GREATER THAN.
                   COUNT<NNN - COUNT LESS THAN.
                   COUNT=NNN - COUNT EQUAL TO.
                   WHERE NNN IS ANY NUMBER OF ONE TO SEVEN DIGITS.
0   (4)  TITLE = - FOLLOWED BY UP TO EIGHTY CHARACTERS DELI-
         OR
                   MITED BY THE FIRST COMMA FOLLOWING "TITLE="
         T=
                   (OR T=).  THIS TITLE IS INSERTED IN THE
                   HEADING LINE NEXT TO THE PROGRAM DESCRIPTION.
                   ANY PRINTABLE CHARACTER MAY BE USED, BUT
                   REMEMBER THAT A QUOTE MARK MUST BE CODED
                   TWICE AS THE WHOLE PARM MUST BE ENCLOSED IN
                   QUOTES.
0   THE ABOVE PARAMETERS MAY BE CODED IN ANY ORDER SO LONG
    AS THE NORMAL RULES FOR CODING PARMS ARE ADHERED TO.
0   PARM SUMMARY :
    ------------
         UL   ND   C    =    T=
                        >
    PARM='UNLIKE,NODUMP,COUNT<NNNNNNN,TITLE=USERTITLE'
    SELECT ANY OR ALL OF THESE IN LONG OR SHORT FORM.
