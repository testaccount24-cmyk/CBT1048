01. PURPOSE
 ----------
0   THIS SUBROUTINE POSITIONS AN INDEXED SEQUENTIAL DATA SET ON SOME
    ITEM OR ITEM CLASS WITHIN THE DATA SET PRIOR TO SEQUENTIAL PROCESSING.
0   ONCE THE POSITION OF THE FILE HAS BEEN SET WITH THIS SUBROUTINE,
    RECORDS MAY BE RETRIEVED SEQUENTIALLY FROM THAT POINT BY USING THE
    READ STATEMENT, UNTIL EITHER THE FILE IS CLOSED OR ANOTHER CALL TO
    THE SUBROUTINE IS ISSUED.
0   UT422 MAY BE USED AS OFTEN AS REQUIRED WITHIN A PROGRAM.
02. LIMITATIONS
 --------------
0   1.   UT421 MUST HAVE BEEN USED ON THE FILE BEFORE THE FILE WAS
         OPENED.
0   2.   THE FILE MUST BE OPEN WHEN UT422 IS CALLED.
0   3.   THIS SUBROUTINE CAN BE USED ONLY BY COBOL PROGRAMS.
03. INPUT DATA
 -------------
0   NONE.
04. OUTPUT DATA
 --------------
0   NONE.
05. OPERATION
 ------------
0   THE CODING REQUIRED IS
    ENTER LINKAGE.
    CALL 'UT422' USING FILE-NAME, DATA-NAME-1, DATA-NAME-2.
    ENTER COBOL.
    WHERE FILE-NAME IS THE NAME OF THE FILE (AS SPECIFIED IN THE SELECT
    AND FD CLAUSES) TAT IS TO BE POSITIONED.
0   DATA-NAME-1 IS A SINGLE BYTE FIELD USED TO INDICATE THE TYPE OF
    POSITIONING REQUIRED.  THE CODES ARE:-
0   1=THAT A SEARCH IS TO BE MADE FOR A SPECIFIC KEY.
0   2=THAT A SEARCH IS TO BE MADE FOR A PARTICULAR KEY CLASS(E.G. ALL
         ACCOUNT NUMBERS BEGINNING WITH 67 IN A SIX-DIGIT ACCOUNT NUMBER).
0   3=THAT THE DATA SET IS TO BE POSITIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
         FILE.
0   DATA-NAME-2 MUST CONTAIN THE KEY OR KEY CLASS ON WHICH THE POSITIONING
    OF THE FILE IS TO BE BASED.  THE SUBROUTINE WILL POSITION THE INDEXED
    SEQUENTIAL DATA SET SO THAT THE NEXT READ ON THE FILE MAKES THE RECORD
    WITH THE SPECIFIED KEY, OR THE FIRST RECORD OF THE SPECIFIED KEY
    CLASS, AVAILABLE IN CORE.
0   IF A KEY CLASS SEARCH IS TO BE USED, DATA-NAME-2 MUST BE EQUAL IN
    LENGTH TO THE KEY FIELD OF THE RECORD, WITH THE NON-SIGNIFICANT
    DIGITS CONTAINING LOW-VALUES (HEXADECIMAL 00).
0   IF THE FILE IS TO BE POSITIONED AT THE BEGINNING (I.E. DATA-NAME-1
    CONTAINS A 3), DATA-NAME-2 MAY BE OMITTED.
0   NOTES.
    -----
0   1.   THE OPEN STATEMENT WILL POSITION AN INDEXED SEQUENTIAL FILE
         AT THE START OF THE DATA SET.  IF THIS IS THE ONLY POSITIONING
         REQUIRED, UT421 AND UT422 NEED NOT BE USED.
0   2.   IF THE RECORD FOR WHICH A SEARCH IS MADE IS NOT ON THE FILE,
         THE FILE IS RE-POSITIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DATA SET.
0   3.   THE SELECT STATEMENT FOR THE FILE SHOULD SPECIFY
         ACCESS IS SEQUENTIAL,                 AND ALSO
         ORGANIZATION IS INDEXED.
