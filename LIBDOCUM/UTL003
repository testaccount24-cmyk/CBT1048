01.      PURPOSE
 ---------------
0        THE PROGRAM PRINTS OUT RECORDS OF REPORTS, SELECTED BY ONE OR TWO
    CONTROL CARDS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PRODUCED IN PRINT-TAPE FORMAT.  IN DOING
    SO, CORRECT CARRIAGE TAPES AND STATIONERY ARE REQUESTED TO BE MOUNTED,
    AN ALIGNMENT FEATURE IS PRESENT AND SPACING AND SKIPPING CODES ARE
    ANALYSED AND EXECUTED ACCORDINGLY.  THE FEATURES OF THE CONTROL CARDS
    ALLOW THE USER TO
0        (A)  PRINT ALL REPORTS CONTAINED IN THE PRINT-TAPE DATA SET
              PROVIDED IN THE JCL.
0        (B)  SELECT FROM 1 TO 24 REPORTS FROM THE PRINT-TAPE DATA SET
              SPECIFIED.
0        (C)  OMIT FROM 1 TO 24 REPORTS WHILE PRINTING THE WHOLE PRINT-TAPE
              DATA SET PROVIDED.
02.      LIMITATIONS
 -------------------
0        (A)  WILL ONLY ALLOW UP TO 24 REPORTS TO BE SELECTED OR OMITTED
              IN ONE RUN.
0        (B)  REQUIRES THE INPUT PRINT-TAPE DATA SET TO BE SORTED INTO
              THE SEQUENCE SPECIFIED LATER.  THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE WHEN
              MORE THAN ONE REPORT IS ON THE PRINT-TAPE DATA SET.
0        (C)  STATIONERY AND CARRIAGE TAPES ARE LIMITED TO THE CODES
              CONTAINED IN THE DESCRIPTION TABLES.
03.      INPUT DATA
 ------------------
0        (A)  PRINT-TAPE DATA SET CONTAINING PRINT IMAGES TO BE LISTED.
              (SEE APPENDIX A).
0        (B)  CARRIAGE CONTROL TAPE DESCRIPTION TABLE.  (SEE APPENDIX B).
0        (C)  STATIONERY DESCRIPTION TABLE. (SEE APPENDIX C).
0        (D)  CONTROL CARD DATA SET CONTAINING MODE OF OPERATION AND
              REPORT NUMBERS.  (SEE APPENDIX D).
0        THE PRINT-TAPE DATA SET MUST BE IN THE SEQUENCE
              REPORT LINE NUMBER WITHIN
              REPORT NUMBER WITHIN
              STATIONERY TYPE CODE WITHIN
              CARRIAGE TAPE CODE.
1************
 * UTL003   *
 ************
0        THE CARRIAGE TAPE AND STATIONERY TABLES MUST BE IN ASCENDING SEQUENCE
    ON CARRIAGE TAPE CODES AND STATIONERY TYPE CODES.  THE CONTROL CARD DATA
    SET MUST BE IN REPORT NUMBER WITHIN FORMAT SEQUENCE.
04.      OUTPUT DATA
 -------------------
0        (A)  REQUESTED PRINTER OUTPUT.
0        (B)  MESSAGES (TO WHICH REPLIES ARE REQUIRED) ON THE CONSOLE
              TYPEWRITER.
05.      OPERATION
 -----------------
0        THE JOB CONTROL STATEMENTS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO EXECUTE THIS PROGRAM
    ARE:
         //   EXEC      PGM=UTL003
         //SYSPRINT     DD  SYSOUT=A
         //UTL3B        DD  (PRINT-TAPE DD INFORMATION)

         //UTL3D        DD  (CARRIAGE TAPE TABLE DD INFORMATION)
         //UTL3A        DD  *
              (CONTROL CARD INFORMATION
         /*
0        THE PRESENCE OF THE PARAMETER 'TEST' IN THE EXEC CARD GIVES THE
    FOLLOWING FEATURES TO SAVE A LOT OF TIME WHEN TESTING.
0        (A)  FLAGS INVALID CONTROL CARDS AND CONTINUES.
0        (B)  FLAGS SEQUENCE ERRORS IN PRINT-TAPE FILE.
0        (C)  FLAGS INVALID SKIP CODES - ASSUMES 1 SPACE AND CONTINUES.
         SAMPLE CONTROL CARDS AND THEIR MEANINGS ARE BELOW.
              C.C.1
0        (I)  A06B
              THIS WILL CAUSE ALL REPORTS ON THE PRINT-TAPE DATA SET TO
              BE OUTPUT-ED ON THE PRINTER.
