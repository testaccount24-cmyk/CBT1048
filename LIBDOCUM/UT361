01. PURPOSE
 ----------
0   THE PROGRAM CREATES TEMPORARY DATA SETS FROM CARD DATA
    FURNISHED BY THE USER.  THESE DATA SETS ARE THEN USED AS
    INPUT TO THE USERS PROGRAM FOR TESTING PURPOSES.
02. LIMITATIONS
 --------------
0   NONE.
03. INPUT DATA
 -------------
0   CARDS, CONTAINING THE DATA TO BE PLACED ON THE DATA SET
    AND CERTAIN CONTROL INFORMATION, ARE USED AS INPUT TO
    THIS PROGRAM.  CARD FORMAT IS AS FOLLOWS:
0   CC     NAME         PURPOSE
    --     ----         -------
0   1-4    SEQUENCER    USER ASSIGNED NUMBER FOR SEQUENCING
                        PURPOSE ONLY.
0   5-6    OPERATION    INDICATES THE ACTION TO BE TAKEN
                        WITH THE DATA IN THE DATA PORTION
                        OF THE CARD.
0   7-8    COUNT        NUMBER OF CHARACTERS TO BE LOADED.
0   9-10   LEAVE BLANK.
0   11-80  DATA         DATA TO BE PLACED ON THE GENERATED
                        DATA SET.
0   THE OPERATION CODE MUST BE WT, PF, BI, BH, OR BLANK.  WT
    AND BLANK CAUSE THE DATA STARTING IN COLUMN 11 TO BE PLACED IN
    THE WRITE AREA IN CHARACTER FORM (ONE CHARACTER PER BYTE).
    THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS MOVED IS 70 UNLESS A COUNT IS
    SPECIFIED IN COLUMNS 7-8 IN WHICH CASE THE COUNT DETERMINES
    THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS MOVED.
0   AFTER THE DATA IS MOVED TO THE WRITE AREA, A DATA SET
    RECORD IS WRITTEN IF THE CARD CONTAINS WT IN THE OPERATION
    FIELD.

0   THE OPERATION CODE PF IS USED TO CREATE PACKED
    NUMERIC FIELDS.  IF PF IS PRESENT IN THE OPERATION
    FIELD, THE FOLLOWING RESTRICTIONS APPLY:
0        1)   EACH FIELD TO BE PACKED MUST NOT EXCEED 18
              POSITIONS IN LENGTH.
0        2)   STANDARD SIGNS MUST APPEAR IN THE UNITS
              POSITION OF EACH FIELD
0        3)   ANY NUMBER OF FIELDS MAY BE INDICATED.
0        4)   A FIELD MAY NOT BE SPLIT BETWEEN TWO CARDS.
0        5)   EACH PF CARD IS SCANNED LEFT TO RIGHT START-
              ING IN COLUMN 11.  EACH SIGN DELIMITS A FIELD
              AND THE FIRST BLANK DELIMITS THE CARD.
0        6)   ONLY NUMBERS, WITH OR WITHOUT SIGNS, AND
              BLANKS ARE ALLOWED IN THE DATA PORTION OF
              THE CARD.
0        7)   THE COUNT FIELD COLUMN 7 AND 8 ARE NOT REQUIRED.
0   THE OPERATION CODE BI IS USED TO CREATE BINARY FULLWORD
    INTEGERS.  THE FOLLOWING USAGE AND RESTRICTIONS APPLY:
0        1)   NO CHARACTERS EXCEPT THE DIGITS 0-9, BLANKS OR
              THE SIGNS + OR - ARE ALLOWED IN COLUMNS 11-80.
0        2)   EVERY COLUMN, 11 THROUGH 80, IS SCANNED.
0        3)   THE COUNT FIELD COLUMNS 7 AND 8, ARE IGNORED.
0        4)   EACH CONSTANT MUST NOT EXCEED 9 DIGITS.
0        5)   THE CHARACTERS BLANK, + OR - DELIMIT EACH CONSTANT.
0        6)   EACH CONSTANT MAY BE PRECEDED OR FOLLOWED BY ONE
              OR MORE BLANKS, OR
0        7)   THE CONSTANTS MAY BE "PACKED" ON THE CARD WITH
              ONLY THE SIGNS + OR - USED AS SEPARATORS.
              FOR EXAMPLE:
0             11 - COLUMNS ---------- 80
0             1    -2   +3             FOR READING EASE
0             1-2+3-4+5 6              FOR MAXIMUM CONSTANTS PER CARD
1************

 ************
0   THE OPERATION CODE BH IS USED TO CREATE BINARY
    HALFWORD INTEGERS.  THE USAGE AND RESTRICTIONS
    ARE THE SAME AS FOR BI EXCEPT THAT NO MORE THAN
    FOUR DIGITS ARE ALLOWED PER CONSTANT.
04. OUTPUT
 ---------
0   OUTPUT FROM THIS PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE DATA
    SET REQUIRED BY THE USER AND A LISTING OF THE
    RECORD NUMBERS WRITTEN ALONG WITH THEIR CORRESPONDING
    LENGTH IN BYTES.  OR AN EDIT LISTING OF ERRORS
    DISCOVERED IN THE DATA CARDS.  THE ERROR MESSAGES
    ARE SELF EXPLANATORY AND CLEARLY INDICATE THE CARD/S
    IN ERROR.  IF, AFTER ALL THE CARDS HAVE BEEN SCANNED,
    ANY ERRORS ARE FOUND THE PROGRAM WILL ABNORMALLY
    TERMINATE.
05. OPERATION
 ------------
0   UT361 HAS BEEN CATALOGUED AND PLACED IN THE OS/360
    LIBRARY.  THE FOLLOWING CONTROL CARDS ARE REQUIRED
    TO CAUSE LOADING AND EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAM:
0        //NAME EXEC PGM=UT361
         //TESTDATA DD SEE BELOW
         //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A
         //DSGCARDS DD *
              DATA CARDS FOR UT361
         /*
0   ALL CODES AND MNEMONICS IN CAPITAL LETTERS ARE REQUIRED
    ITEMS AND MUST BE PUNCHED AS SHOWN.  THE BODY OF THE DD
    CARD LABELED TESTDATA SHOULD BE FILLED IN AS REQUIRED
    FOR THE JOB BEING RUN.  REGARDING THIS CARD, THE FOLLOWING
    COMMENTS APPLY:
0        1)   DISPOSITION OF THE FILE SHOULD BE NEW, PASS.
              DISP=(,PASS)
0        2)   THE DCB PARAMETER IS NECESSARY ONLY IF THE
              DATA SET IS TO BE WRITTEN ON 7-TRACK TAPE IN
              WHICH CASE THE DEN AND TRTCH SUBPARAMETERS
              SHOULD BE GIVEN.  AS ACCURATELY AS CAN BE
              DETERMINED AT THIS POINT, IT IS UNNECESSARY
              TO GIVE ANY OTHER DCB SUBPARAMETERS.
