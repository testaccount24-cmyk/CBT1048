01. PURPOSE
 ----------
0   THIS ROUTINE IS INTENDED AS AN AID TO PROGRAMMERS WHOSE PROGRAMS
    ARE VERY LARGE, AND ARE IN DANGER OF EXCEEDING THE AVAILABLE CORE.
02. LIMITATIONS
 --------------
0   N/A
03. INPUT DATA
 -------------
0   NONE.
04. OUTPUT DATA
 --------------
0   NONE.
05. OPERATION
 ------------
0   1.   COBOL:-
         ENTER LINKAGE.
         CALL 'SIZEUP' USING DATA-NAME.
         ENTER COBOL.
         WHERE DATA-NAME IS THE NAME OF AN EIGHT-BYTE AREA WHERE THE
         ROUTINE IS TO PUT THE PROGRAM SIZE.  THE RESULT IS A DECIMAL
         NUMBER STORED IN DISPLAY FORM WITH LEADING ZEROS.
0   2.   FORTRAN:-
         CALL SIZEUP(DATA-NAME)
         WHERE DATA-NAME IS THE NAME OF AN EIGHT-BYTE AREA WHERE THE
         ROUTINE IS TO PUT THE PROGRAM SIZE.  THE RESULT WILL BE A
         DECIMAL NUMBER STORED IN ALPHA FORMAT WITH LEADING ZEROS.
0        THIS SUBROUTINE MAY BE CALLED AS MANY TIMES AS REQUIRED DURING A GIVEN
         RUN, IN ORDER TO SEE HOW CORE UTILISATION VARIES DURING PROGRAM EXEC-
         UTION.
