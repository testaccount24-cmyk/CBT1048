01. PURPOSE
 ----------
0       USING PL/1, IT IS POSSIBLE TO ALLOCATE AND
    FREE CORE WITHIN THE OBJECT PROGRAM AT EXECUTION
    TIME, AND THUS TO OPTIMISE CORE USAGE.  FOR EXAM-
    PLE, IT IS POSSIBLE TO ALTER THE SIZE OF A WORK-
    ARRAY, OR TO ALTER THE AMOUNT OF CORE AVAILABLE
    TO A DYNAMICALLY INVOKED SORT.
0       FOR THIS FACILITY TO BE UTILISED SATISFAC-
    TORILY, IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE OBJECT PROGRAM
    TO KNOW THE AMOUNT OF FREE CORE THAT IS AVAILA-
    BLE IN THE PARTITION, AND THE FUNCTION OF UT463
    IS TO SUPPLY THIS INFORMATION.
0       NOTE THAT UT463 MAY ALSO BE INVOKED BY
    COBOL, RPG, AND ASSEMBLER PROGRAMS.
02. LIMITATIONS
 --------------
0   1.   THIS PROGRAM WAS WRITTEN FOR AN OS/MFT ENVI-
         RONMENT, AND MAY REQUIRE MODIFICATION FOR MVT.
03. INPUT DATA

05. OPERATION
 ------------
0   TO INVOKE UT 463 FROM PL.1, THE FOLLOWING
    CODING IS REQUIRED:
0        DCL  STRINGA  CHAR(B),
              PARMA FIXED DEC(1,0)  BASED(P);
         P = ADDR(STRINGA);
         CALL CORECHK(PARMA);
0   WHEN CONTROL IS RETURNED TO THE PL/1 CALLING
    PROGRAM,THE AMOUNT OF FREE CORE AVAILABLE
    WILL BE IN THE FIELD STRINGA AS AN EIGHT DI-
    GIT NUMBER, WITH LEADING ZEROES.
0   TO INVOKE UT 463 FROM COBOL, STATEMENTS OF THE
    FORM:
0        77  CORE - LEFT  PICTURE 9(8).
0        ENTER LINKAGE.
         CALL CORECHK USING CORE-LEFT.
         ENTER COBOL.
0   ARE REQUIRED.
0   TO USE THE SUB-ROUTINE FROM RPG, IT IS NECES-
    SARY TO USE THE INTERMEDIARY SUB-ROUTINE MINGE
    (UT 425).
