0ABSTRACT
 IF, IN THE JCL, A GENERATION DATA SET IS REFERENCED WITHOUT A
 QUALIFYING GENERATION NUMBER, THEN THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY
 CONCATENATES ALL THE GENERATIONS FOUND IN THE CATALOG. THIS IS A
 USEFUL FACILITY BUT IS MARRED BY THE FACT THAT THE GENERATIONS ARE
 CONCATENATED IN REVERSE ORDER. (STARTING WITH THE YOUNGEST).
   FREQUENTLY IT IS NECCESSARY TO RETRIEVE ALL THE DATA FROM A GDG
 IN THE CORRECT ORDER. (STARTING WITH THE OLDEST).

01.      PURPOSE
+_______________
   THIS UTILITY WILL ALLOW ALL THE GENERATIONS OF A GDG TO BE READ
 IN THE CORRECT ORDER AND COPIED TO A SINGLE OUTPUT FILE FOR LATER
 PROCESSING BY ANOTHER PROGRAM.
02.      LIMITATIONS
+___________________
   THE INPUT CONCATENATED DATA SET WILL NORMALLY BE A GDG ON DISK, BUT
 CAN BE ANY OF ONE OR MORE CONCATENATED DISK FILES, TAPE FILES, OR SYSIN
 DATA SETS. THESE CAN BE IN ANY ORDER AND ANY TYPE OF FILE BUT, APART
 FROM SYSIN FILES, MUST BE CATALOGED. AS YET, THE UTILITY WILL NOT HANDLE
 UNCATALOGED DATA SETS. THIS IS AN AREA FOR FUTURE DEVELOPEMENT.

03.      INPUT DATA
+__________________
   INPUT TO THE PROGRAM IS A SERIES OF FILES SPECIFIED ON THE
 SYSUT1 DD STATEMENT AND MAY BE SIMPLY ONE UNQUALIFIED GDG (I.E. NO
 GENERATION NUMBER) OR MULTIPLE UNQUALIFIED GDG'S OR ANY OTHER SERIES
 OF FILES INCLUDING SYSIN.

04.      OUTPUT DATA
+___________________
   THE PROGRAM PRODUCES A SINGLE SEQUENTIAL FILE ON THE SYSUT2 DD STATEMENT
 AND ALL THE INPUT DATA WILL BE COPIED ACROSS TO THIS.
   ALSO OUTPUT, IF THE SYSPRINT DD STATEMENT IS PRESENT, IS A LIST OF
 ALL THE INPUT DATA SET NAMES AND A COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF RECORDS READ
 FROM EACH AS WELL AS A CUMULATIVE TOTAL FOR ALL THE FILES COPIED.

05.      OPERATION
+_________________
   THE PROGRAM OPERATES BY SCANNING THE TIOT FOR THE SYSUT1 DD ENTRY
 AND EXTRACTING FROM THAT THE ADDRESSES OF ALL THE JFCB'S PRESENT IN THE
 CONCATENATION. EACH JFCB ADDRESS IS THEN PROCESSES IN TURN STARTING
 WITH THE LAST AND WORKING BACK TO THE FIRST.
    THE PROGRAM DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATES THE DATA SET SPECIFIED IN THE JFCB
 IT IS PROCESSING, OPENS A DCB FOR IT, AND COPIES IT TO THE OUTPUT FILE
 WHEN ALL FILES ARE COPIED, THE OUTPUT FILE IS CLOSED AND CONTROL
 RETURN TO THE CALLER.
   IF REQUIRED A JCL PARM ('MAX=NN') CAN BE SPECIFIED TO LIMIT THE
 PROCESSING TO THAT NUMBER ('NN') OF MOST RECENT GENERATIONS.
