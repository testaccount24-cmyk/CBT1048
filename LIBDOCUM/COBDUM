01. PURPOSE
 ----------
    THE PROGRAM AIDS THE ANALYST BY SUPPLYING A GIVEN USER CODE
    AND ABNORMALLY TERMINATING THE JOB ANYWHERE IN THE USERS
    PROGRAM.
02. LIMITATIONS
 --------------
0A) WILL ONLY ACCEPT A 3-DIGIT USER CODE FROM THE COBOL CALLING
    PROGRAM.
0B) WILL ONLY SUPPLY AN INDICATIVE DUMP IF SYSABEND CARD IS NOT
    INCLUDED.
0C) WILL NOT SUPPLY VALID BUFFER ADDRESSES OF LAST I/O OPERATIONS
    IF CALLED AFTER DATA SETS HAVE BEEN CLOSED.

03. INPUT DATA
 -------------
0   INPUT TO THIS ROUTINE IS A 3-BYTE FIELD CONTAINING THE
    REQUIRED USER CODE.  THIS IS DEFINED IN THE WORKING-STORAGE
    SECTION WITH A 77 LEVEL ENTRY.  THE DATA-NAME MUST NOT
    EXCEED 6 CHARACTERS - ALL ALPHABETIC.
04. OUTPUT DATA
 --------------
0   THERE IS NO OUTPUT AS SUCH, JUST A DUMP WITH THE REQUIRED
    USER CODE.
05. OPERATION
 ------------
0   THREE COBOL STATEMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO CALL AND EXECUTE THIS
    ROUTINE IN ADDITION TO THE WORKING-STORAGE SECTION ENTRY
    DEFINING THE USER CODE.  THESE STATEMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS:
0   DATA DIVISION.
    WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
    77   USERCD    PICTURE XXX VALUE '777'.
    PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    PARAGRAPH-NAME.
         ENTER LINKAGE.
         CALL 'COBDUM' USING USERCD
         ENTER COBOL.
         STOP RUN.
0   THE VALUE OF THE DATA-NAME SPECIFIED MUST BE NUMERIC WITH
    NO BLANKS.  IN ORDER TO EFFECT A FULL DUMP OF CORE STORAGE,
    A SYSABEND CARD MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE USER'S JOB CONTROL
    CARDS FOR THE CALLING PROGRAM, OR ELSE JUST AN INDICATIVE
    DUMP WILL RESULT.

0   WE HAVE, FOR SOME YEARS, BEEN THE PROUD POSSESSORS OF A
    SUB-ROUTINE NAMED COBDUM WHICH ENABLES COBOL PROGRAMS
    TO ABNORMALLY TERMINATE WITH A USER-SPECIFIED ABEND CODE.
    HOWEVER, IN MANY CASES, THE CONTENTS OF THE DUMP ITSELF
    ARE NOT NEEDED FOR DEBUGGING PURPOSES, SINCE THE ABEND
    CODE ITSELF CAN EXPLICITLY DEFINE THE PROBLEM.
0   IN ORDER TO PREVENT THIS UNNECESSARY WASTE OF PAPER, I
    HAVE MODIFIED COBDUM SO THAT AN ABEND CAN BE INVOKED
    WITHOUT PRINTING THE DUMP.  THIS ECOLOGICALLY USEFUL
    ENHANCEMENT SHOULD BE USED THUS :
0   ENTER LINKAGE.
    CALL 'COBDUMN'USING X.
    ENTER COBOL.
0   WHERE X IS A THREE-BYTE DISPLAY FIELD CONTAINING A RIGHT-
    ADJUSTED NUMBER.  THIS WILL RESULT IN AN ABNORMAL TERMINA-
    TION OF THE JOB, BUT WITH NO CORE DUMP.
0   IF A CORE DUMP IS REQUIRED, THEN 'COBDUM' SHOULD BE USED,
    AS IN THE DAYS OF YORE.
