01) PURPOSE :
 ----------
0   CERTAIN PROGRAMS - NOTABLY, THE IBM UTILITIES - DO
    NOT ABNORMALLY TERMINATE WHEN THEY DETECT AN ERROR
    CONDITION, BUT MERELY SET A NON-ZERO CONDITION CODE.
    DEPENDING ON THE NATURE AND CONTEXT OF THE ERROR,
    THESE ERRORS MAY BE CRITICAL, AND IN CIRCUMSTANCES
    WHERE THEY ARE CRITICAL IT IS ADVISABLE TO BRING
    THEM FORCIBLY TO THE ATTENTION OF THE OPERATOR.
    UT459 WAS WRITTEN SPECIFICALLY TO SUPPLY THE FACI-
    LITY OF A CONDITIONAL ABEND WITHIN A JOB.
02) LIMITATIONS :
 --------------
0   (1)  UT459 WILL NOT ACCEPT A USER COMPLETION CODE
         GREATER THAN 4095 (OS RESTRICTION).
0   (2)  UT459 DOES NOT VERIFY THAT THE USER-SUPPLIED
         COMPLETION CODE IS NUMERIC.  (I CONSIDERED IT
         A RATHER FUTILE EXERCISE TO PREVENT OC7'S IN
         A UTILITY WHOSE SOLE PURPOSE IS TO ABEND) .
03) INPUT DATA :
 -------------
0   THE USER MAY OPTIONALLY SPECIFY A PARM IN THE EXEC
    STATEMENT INVOKING THE UTILITY :  IF A PARM IS
    PRESENT, IT IS USED AS THE ABEND COMPLETION CODE.
    IF NO PARM IS CODED, OR IT IS INVALID, THE UTILITY
    ABENDS WITH A COMPLETION CODE OF 459.
04) OUTPUT DATA :
 --------------
0   NONE.

05) OPERATION :
 ------------
0   THE ONLY JCL REQUIRED TO INVOKE UT459 IS AN EXEC
    STATEMENT.
0   EXAMPLES :
0   //STEP99  EXEC  PGM=UT459,PARM=37,COND=(O,EQ)
0   //STEP99  EXEC  PGM=ABEND,COND=(16,NE)
0   //STEP99  EXEC  PGM=ABEND,PARM=1234,COND=(12,LT)
