    THE USER HAS TO JUXTAPOSE OR OVERLAP SEVERAL SETS OF
    4 CHARACTERS IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS MODIFICATION.
03) INPUT DATA :

0   (1)  DDNAME SYSDDIN.  ANY SEQUENTIAL DATA SET OR MEMBERS
         OF PARTITIONED DATA SET CONTAINING RECORDS OF 80
         CHARACTERS LENGTH.
    (2)  DDNAME SYSIN.  CONTROL CARD FOR UT483.

0   //STEP01  EXEC      PGM=UT483
    //SYSDDIN DD        DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB(APEX),DISP=SHR
    //PUNCH   DD        SYSOUT=B
    //SYSIN   DD        *
      K008K009,PLYFPL1F
    /*
0   THIS EXAMPLE SHOWS HOW TO MODIFY THE APEX PROCEDURE FROM
    THE PARTITIONED DATA SET SYS1.PROCLIB, DKS008 WILL BE
