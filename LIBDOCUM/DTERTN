01.      PURPOSE
 ---------------
0             THE PROGRAM PROVIDES THE IPL CALENDAR DATE IN AN EDITED
         FORM READY FOR PRINTED OUTPUT.
02.      LIMITATIONS
 -------------------
0        1.   WILL ONLY PROVIDE THE DATE USING THE ALPHABETIC MONTH
              AND NOT AS A NUMERIC VALUE.
03.      INPUT DATA
 ------------------
0             INPUT TO THIS SUBROUTINE IS DEPENDENT ON THE LANGUAGE
         OF THE CALLING PROGRAM.  FORTRAN AND COBOL CALLING PROGRAMS
         PROVIDE A FIELD INTO WHICH THE DATE IS EDITED AND RETURNED,
         RPG AND ASSEMBLER CALLING PROGRAMS ACCESS THE DATE DIRECTLY
         FROM THE SUBROUTINE.
04.      OUTPUT DATA
 -------------------
0             OUTPUT FROM THIS SUBROUTINE IS THE EDITED DATE AREA
         - A NINE CHARACTER FIELD WHEN RETURNED TO COBOL, RPG AND
         ASSEMBLER CALLING PROGRAMS, A THREE WORD ARRAY WHEN RETURNED
         TO FORTRAN CALLING PROGRAMS.
05.      OPERATION
 -----------------
0             THE EDITED FORMAT OF THE DATE IS:
                           DD MMM YY
         FOR EXAMPLE       17 NOV 67
              IN ORDER TO USE DTERTN, PROGRAMS MUST CONFORM TO CERTAIN
         CONDITIONS.
0        A)   RPG
              ---
0        RPG PROGRAMS MAY ACCESS THE EDITED DATE AREA, DEFINED AS
         'JPDATE', DIRECTLY BY INCLUDING A ULABL ENTRY IN THE RPG
         CODING, USING JPDATE AS THE OPERAND.  THIS ENTRY ALLOWS
         THE RPG PROGRAM TO ADDRESS DATA FIELDS WHICH ARE NOT DEFINED
         IN THE RPG PROGRAM.  THE RPG PROGRAM MUST INCLUDE THE
         FOLLOWING STATEMENTS IN ORDER TO CALL AND EXECUTE DTERTN:
0             OPERATION FACTOR 2  RESULT FIELD   FIELD LENGTH
              -----------------------------------------------
              EXIT      DTERTN
              ULABL               JPDATE              9
0        THESE STATEMENT WILL, OF COURSE, INCLUDE THE RELEVANT
         INDICATORS TO THE PROGRAM.

0        B)   COBOL
              -----
0        COBOL PROGRAMS, IN ORDER TO USE THE ROUTINE, MUST DEFINE A
         NINE POSITION ALPHANUMERIC FIELD WITH A DISPLAY USAGE.
         THIS MAY BE GIVEN ANY NAME OF SIX CHARACTERS OR LESS IN A
         LEVEL 77 ENTRY IN THE WORKING-STORAGE SECTION OF THE
         DATA DIVISION.  THIS FIELD MUST BE DEFINED WITH AN INITIAL
         VALUE OF 'COBOLDATE' WHICH ALLOWS DTERTN TO RECOGNISE THE
         CALLING PROGRAM AS A COBOL PROGRAM.  THE CALLING PROGRAM
         MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS IN ORDER TO CALL AND
         EXECUTE DTERTN:
              C C
0   8       12
    -       --

            E N T E R  C O B O L .
0        C)   ASSEMBLER
              ---------
         ASSEMBLER PROGRAMS MAY ACCESS THE EDITED DATE AREA, DEFINED
         AS 'JPDATE', DIRECTLY BY INCLUDING A V-TYPE ADDRESS CONSTANT
         OF JPDATE IN THE ASSEMBLER CODING.  THIS TYPE OF ENTRY ALLOWS
         THE ASSEMBLER PROGRAM TO ADDRESS DATA FIELDS NOT DEFINED IN
         THE ASSEMBLER PROGRAM.  THE ASSEMBLER PROGRAM MUST INCLUDE
         THE FOLLOWING CODING IN ORDER TO CALL AND EXECUTE DTERTN:
                   L         15, DATEADDR   LOAD BRANCH ADDRESS OF DTERTN
                   BALR      14, 15         TO REG 15 AND BAL.
                   L         6, ACTUALDT    ON RETURN, LOAD DATE FIELD
                   - - - - - - - - - -      ADDRESS INTO A REGISTER.
                   - - - - - - - - - -
         DATEADDR  DC        V(DTERTN)      V-TYPE ADCON OF DTERTN
         ACTUALDT  DC        V(JPDATE)      V-TYPE ADCON OF DATE FIELD.

 --------------------------
0        D)   FORTRAN
              -------
0        FORTRAN PROGRAMS MAY USE THE ROUTINE BY PROVIDING AN INTEGER
         ARRAY OF THREE WORDS WHICH HAS A NAME OF 6 CHARACTERS OR LESS.
         THIS ARRAY MUST INITIALLY HAVE THREE VALUES - ONE IN EACH
         WORD - IN ORDER THAT DTERTN MAY RECOGNISE THE CALLING PROGRAM
         AS A FORTRAN PROGRAM.  BECAUSE OF THE RESTRICTIONS IN
         CHARACTER USAGE IN FORTRAN, THE THREE INITIAL VALUES NEED
         TO BE NEGATIVE AS FOLLOWS:
0                  -  1009335594
                   -  742080029
                   -  985644992
0        THE CALLING PROGRAM MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING CODING IN
         ORDER TO CALL AND EXECUTE DTERTN:
0                  DIMENSION  DATE (3)
                   INTEGER DATE
                   DATE (1)=-1009335594
                   DATE (2)=-742080029
                   DATE (3)=-985644992
                   CALL DTERTN (DATE (1))
