0        THERE IS NO NEED TO DEFINE SEVEN FIELDS IN EACH CONTROL CARD,
         BUT IF YOU CHOOSE TO SPECIFY LESS, YOU MUST USE THE 'TYPE/LENGTH'
         SLOTS SEQUENTIALLY FROM LEFT TO RIGHT.
0        COMMENTS CAN BE INCLUDED IN CONTROL CARDS BY LEAVING AT LEAST
         TEN CARD COLUMNS BLANK BEFORE STARTING THE COMMENT.

0        CHR (CHARACTER) - AN OUTPUT FIELD OF EBCDIC CHARACTERS IS GENERATED
         AS AN IMAGE OF THE INPUT FIELD FOR THE LENGTH OF THE OUTPUT FIELD.
         THE INPUT FIELD IS RIGHT-ALIGNED IN THE OUTPUT FIELD.  IF THE
         INPUT FIELD IS SHORTER THAN THE OUTPUT LENGTH SPECIFICATION, THE
         OUTPUT FIELD IS PADDED ON THE LEFT WITH CHARACTER BLANKS.
0        BIN (BINARY) - AN OUTPUT FIXED POINT BINARY FIELD IS GENERATED FROM
         AN INPUT DECIMAL VALUE.  THE RESULTING FIELD IS SIGNED PLUS IF NO
         INPUT SIGN IS PRESENT.  THE RESULTING OUTPUT FIELD IS SIGNED MINUS
         IF THE INPUT FIELD IS SIGNED MINUS, THE THE MINUS SIGN OF THE INPUT
         FIELD MUST BE WRITTEN IMMEDIATELY TO THE RIGHT OF THE INPUT VALUE.
         AN OUTPUT LENGTH OF 1, 2, 3 OR 4 BYTES CAN BE SPECIFIED.  THE
         OUTPUT VALUE IS RIGHT JUSTIFIED IN THE OUTPUT FIELD, AND LEFT
         PADDED WITH THE BINARY SIGN.
0        HEX (HEXADECIMAL) - AN OUTPUT FIELD OF HEXADECIMAL DIGITS IS
         GENERATED (TWO HEX DIGITS PER OUTPUT BYTE).  THE INPUT FIELD IS
         WRITTEN AS HEX DIGITS IN THE RANGE 0 - 9, A - F.  THE OUTPUT HEX
         CHARACTERS ARE RIGHT JUSTIFIED IN THE OUTPUT FIELD.  IF THE INPUT
         FIELD DOES NOT CONTAIN ENOUGH CHARACTERS TO SATISFY THE OUTPUT
         LENGTH REQUIREMENTS, THE OUTPUT FIELD IS PADDED ON THE LEFT WITH
         HEX ZEROES.  THE MAXIMUM OUTPUT LENGTH SPECIFICATION IS 120 BYTES,
         AND THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF INPUT HEX DIGITS THAT CAN BE WRITTEN IS
         240.
0        PAK (PACKED DECIMAL) - AN OUTPUT FIELD OF PACKED DECIMAL DIGITS IS
         GENERATED FROM AN INPUT DECIMAL VALUE.  THE OUTPUT FIELD IS
         SIGNED MINUS IF THE INPUT FIELD IS SIGNED MINUS, OTHERWISE THE
         OUTPUT FIELD IS SIGNED PLUS.  THE MINUS SIGN OF THE INPUT FIELD,
         IF USED, IS PLACED IMMEDIATELY TO THE RIGHT OF THE INPUT DECIMAL
         VALUE.  THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF INPUT DIGITS THAT CAN BE WRITTEN IS
         16.  IF THE INPUT FIELD IS NOT LONG ENOUGH TO SATISFY THE LENGTH
         REQUIREMENTS OF THE OUTPUT FIELD, THE OUTPUT FIELD IS LEFT PADDED
         WITH PACKED ZEROES.

0        FIL (FILLER) - AN OUTPUT FIELD IS FILLED WITH A PAIR OF INPUT
         HEXADECIMAL DIGITS.  THE INPUT FIELD MUST BE WRITTEN AS A SINGLE
         PAIR OF HEXADECIMAL DIGITS, AND THESE DIGITS ARE PROPAGATED THROUGH
         THE OUTPUT FIELD FOR THE LENGTH OF THE OUTPUT FIELD.
0        BNS (STEP BINARY) - IN THE VERY FIRST OUTPUT RECORD GENERATED FOR
         THE OUTPUT DATA SET, A FIXED POINT BINARY FIELD IS PRODUCED IN
         EXACTLY THE SAME MANNER AS IN THE BIN (BINARY) OUTPUT FORMAT.
         THE VALUE IN THE INITIAL BNS FIELD IS INCREMENTED CUMULATIVELY IN
         SUCCEEDING OUTPUT RECORDS BY WHATEVER VALUE IS SPECIFIED IN
         SUCCEEDING INPUT RECORDS.  THE INITIAL VALUE AND INCREMENTING
         VALUES ARE SIGNED PLUS IF NO INPUT SIGN IS SPECIFIED, AND SIGNED
         MINUS IF A MINUS SIGN IS SPECIFIED ON THE INPUT FIELD.  A MINUS
         SIGN ON THE INPUT FIELD, IF USED, MUST BE PLACED IMMEDIATELY TO THE
         RIGHT OF THE INPUT DECIMAL VALUE.  A NEW INITIAL VALUE MAY BE
         SPECIFIED AT ANY TIME BY WRITING AN R IMMEDIATELY TO THE LEFT OF
         THE INPUT DECIMAL VALUE: THIS CAUSES THE BNS FIELD TO BE RESET TO
         WHATEVER VALUE FOLLOWS THE R.
0        PKS (STEP PACKED DECIMAL) - IN THE VERY FIRST OUTPUT RECORD GENERATED
         FOR THE OUTPUT DATA SET, A PACKED DECIMAL FIELD IS PRODUCED IN
         EXACTLY THE SAME MANNER AS IN THE PAK (PACKED DECIMAL) OUTPUT FORMAT.
         THE VALUE IN THE INITIAL PKS FIELD IS INCREMENTED CUMULATIVELY IN
         SUCCEEDING OUTPUT RECORDS BY WHATEVER VALUE IS SPECIFIED IN
         SUCCEEDING INPUT RECORDS.  THE INITIAL VALUE AND INCREMENTING
         VALUES ARE SIGNED PLUS IF NO INPUT SIGN IS SPECIFIED AND SIGNED
         MINUS IF A MINUS SIGN IS SPECIFIED ON THE INPUT FIELD.  A MINUS
         SIGN ON THE INPUT FIELD, IF USED, MUST BE PLACED IMMEDIATELY TO THE
         RIGHT OF THE INPUT DECIMAL VALUE.  A NEW INITIAL VALUE MAY BE
         SPECIFIED AT ANY TIME BY WRITING AN R IMMEDIATELY TO THE LEFT OF
         THE INPUT DECIMAL VALUE: THIS CAUSES THE PKS FIELD TO BE RESET
         TO WHATEVER VALUE FOLLOWS THE R.
0        CAZ (CHARACTER WITH ZERO PADDING) - AN OUTPUT FIELD OF EBCDIC
         CHARACTERS IS GENERATED AS AN IMAGE OF THE INPUT FIELD FOR THE
         LENGTH OF THE OUTPUT FIELD.  THE INPUT FIELD IS RIGHT ALIGNED IN
         THE OUTPUT FIELD, AND IF THE INPUT FIELD IS SHORTER THAN THE
         OUTPUT LENGTH SPECIFICATION, THE OUTPUT FIELD IS PADDED ON THE LEFT
         WITH CHARACTER ZEROES.
0   2)   DATA CARDS
         ----------
0        DATA FOR CONVERSION IS INTRODUCED TO THE GENERATOR THROUGH INPUT
         DATA CARD GROUPS.   ONE INPUT DATA CARD GROUP MUST BE SUPPLIED FOR
         EACH LOGICAL OUTPUT RECORD WHICH IS TO BE GENERATED, AND ANY NUMBER
         OF CARDS CAN BE USED TO COMPRISE AN INPUT DATA CARD GROUP.  THE
         FOLLOWING GENERAL RULES APPLY WHEN CODING DATA CARD GROUPS:
0        1. CARD COLUMNS 1 - 71 ARE USED FOR CODING DATA FIELDS.
0        2. CARD COLUMN 72 IS CODED WITH AN 'X' TO INDICATE THAT THIS IS THE
            LAST OR ONLY CARD OF A DATA CARD GROUP.   OTHERWISE, COLUMN 72
            MUST BE LEFT BLANK.
0        3. CARD COLUMNS 73 - 80 ARE IGNORED BY UTLGENER, AND MAY BE USED
            FOR ANY PURPOSE THE USER WISHES.

01. PURPOSE
 ----------
0   THE PROGRAM CREATES SEQUENTIAL DATA SETS FROM INPUT CONTROL CARDS
    AND DATA.  OUTPUT RECORD FORMATS CAN BE F, FB, V OR VB.  THE
    PROGRAM PRODUCES BINARY, PACKED DECIMAL, EBCDIC, HEXADECIMAL, FILL,
    BINARY INCREMENTING/DECREMENTING AND PACKED DECIMAL INCREMENTING/
    DECREMENTING FIELDS IN ANY COMBINATION OF ORDER.  ALL OUTPUT
    RECORDS ARE AUTOMATICALLY LISTED IN A NUMBERED CHARACTER/HEX 4-LINE
    FORMAT AS THEY ARE BEING GENERATED.  UTLGENER HAS THE CAPABILITY
    OF REPEATING ENTIRE RECORDS OR SELECTED FIELDS INDEFINITELY.
    THERE IS ONLY ONE TYPE OF CONTROL CARD, AND THE INPUT DATA IS CODED
    IN FREE FORMAT, POSITION-INDEPENDENT NOTATION, WHILE DIAGNOSTIC
    ROUTINES FULLY DOCUMENT ALL ERRORS.
02. LIMITATIONS
 --------------
0   1)   A MAXIMUM OF 99 DATA SETS CAN BE GENERATED IN A SINGLE EXECUTION.
0   2)   MAXIMUM LENGTH OF EACH OUTPUT LOGICAL RECORD IS 4095 BYTES.
0   3)   MAXIMUM NUMBER OF OUTPUT FIELDS PER LOGICAL RECORD IS 256.
03. INPUT
 --------
0   1)   CONTROL CARDS
         -------------
0        THE CONTROL CARDS DEFINE THE CHARACTERISTICS AND LENGTHS OF THE
         OUTPUT FIELDS OF THE DATA SET WHICH IS TO BE GENERATED.  ALL
         FIELDS OF THE OUTPUT RECORD MUST BE DEFINED.  SEVEN OUTPUT
         FIELDS CAN BE DEFINED IN EACH CONTROL CARD, SO USUALLY MORE THAN
         ONE CARD IS REQUIRED TO DEFINE AN ENTIRE OUTPUT RECORD.  OUTPUT
         RECORDS ARE BUILT FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IN THE SAME ORDER AS THE
         FIELDS ARE DEFINED IN THE CONTROL CARDS.
0        THE FORMAT OF THE CONTROL CARDS IS AS FOLLOWS:
0        CARD COLUMNS   1 - 5 *DSG*
                        6 -  7 TWO DIGIT CONTROL CARD SEQUENCE NUMBER
                        10 - 12 OUTPUT FIELD TYPE
                        14 - 16 OUTPUT FIELD LENGTH (IN BYTES)
                        20 - 22 OUTPUT FIELD TYPE
                        24 - 26 OUTPUT FIELD LENGTH (IN BYTES)
                        30 - 32 OUTPUT FIELD TYPE
                        34 - 36 OUTPUT FIELD LENGTH (IN BYTES)
                        40 - 42 OUTPUT FIELD TYPE
                        44 - 46 OUTPUT FIELD LENGTH (IN BYTES)
                        50 - 52 OUTPUT FIELD TYPE
                        54 - 56 OUTPUT FIELD LENGTH (IN BYTES)
                        60 - 62 OUTPUT FIELD TYPE
                        64 - 66 OUTPUT FIELD LENGTH (IN BYTES)
                        70 - 72 OUTPUT FIELD TYPE
                        74 - 76 OUTPUT FIELD LENGTH (IN BYTES)
0        THE PROGRAM DOES NOT CHECK C.C. 6 - 7 OF THE CONTROL CARDS FOR
         PROPER SEQUENCE, AND THE FIELD IS MERELY SUPPLIED FOR THE USERS'
         BENEFIT.

0        4.   THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT DATA FIELDS BEGIN OR END IN ANY
              PARTICULAR CARD COLUMN.  DATA FIELDS CAN BE CODED IN FREE
              FORMAT WITH OR WITHOUT ANY NUMBER OF BLANKS BETWEEN ONE DATA
              FIELD AND THE NEXT.  EACH DATA FIELD MUST BE DELIMITED WITH
              A PERIOD (.).
0        THE FOLLOWING FULES APPLY WHEN CODING FREE FORM DATA FIELDS:
0        1.   EACH INPUT DATA FIELD MAY CONTAIN ANY NUMBER OF LEADING BLANK
              CARD COLUMNS.  LEADING BLANKS ARE ALWAYS IGNORED BY THE
              GENERATOR.
0        2.   EACH INPUT DATA FIELD INCLUDING THE LAST INPUT DATA FIELD OF
              EACH INPUT GROUP MUST BE DELIMITED BY A PERIOD.
0        3.   EACH INPUT DATA CARD GROUP NEED NOT CONTAIN THE SAME NUMBER OF
              CARDS.
0        4.   EACH INPUT DATA CARD NEED NOT CONTAIN THE SAME NUMBER OF FIELDS.
0        5.   INPUT DATA FIELDS CAN BE CONTINUED FROM C.C.71 OF A CARD TO
              C.C.1 OF THE NEXT CARD WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS.
0        6.   REPETITION OF SELECTED OUTPUT FIELD IN A SERIES OF LOGICAL
              RECORDS AND DUPLICATION OF ENTIRE LOGICAL RECORDS CAN BE
              ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT HAVING TO REPEAT THE CORRESPONDING INPUT
              DATA.  AN ENTIRE OUTPUT LOGICAL RECORD IS DUPLICATED IN THE
              FOLLOWING MANNER:
              CARD COLUMN    1    .
                           2 - 71 BLANKS
                            72    X
                          73 - 80 USER INFORMATION.
0             THIS DUPLICATION CAN BE REPEATED AS MANY TIMES AS THE USER
              WISHES.
0             INDIVIDUAL OUTPUT FIELDS CAN BE REPEATED BY CODING A PERIOD WITH
              NOTHING (NEITHER BLANKS NOR DATA) PRECEDING IT.  TO REPEAT THE
              FIRST OUTPUT FIELD OF A LOGICAL RECORD, THE PERIOD MUST BE
              PUNCHED IN COLUMN 1 OF THE INPUT DATA CARD.  ANY TRAILING
              PERIODS USED IN THIS WAY FOR DUPLICATION SHOULD BE OMITTED.
04. OUTPUT
 ---------
0   THE OUTPUT OF UTLGENER IS THE DATA SET, OR DATA SETS, GENERATED.  ALSO
    PRODUCED IS A LISTING IN CHARACTER/HEXADECIMAL,FOUR-LINE FORMAT OF EACH

    HAS BEEN GENERATED, A SYNOPSIS IS PRODUCED ON THE LISTING GIVING THE
    CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DATA SET.
0   IF A CONTROL CARD ERROR IS DETECTED, UTLGENER PRINTS OUT THE CURRENT
    OUTPUT DATA SET DDNAME, THE ERRONEOUS CONTROL CARD, UNDERSCORES THE
    ERRONEOUS PARAMETER WITH ASTERISKS, AND REFERS THE USER TO A CORRECTION
    PROCEDURE WITH A CODED MESSAGE REFERENCE.
1************
 * UTLGENER *

0   IF A DATA CARD ERROR IS DETECTED, UTLGENER PRINTS OUT THE CURRENT
    OUTPUT DATA SET DDNAME, THE INPUT GROUP WHERE THE ERRONEOUS DATA CARD
    IS LOCATED, PRINTS OUT THE NUMBER OF THE FIELD WHICH IS IN ERROR,
    PRINTS OUT A RECORD COUNT OF RECORDS GENERATED THUS FAR, AND REFERS
    THE USER TO A CORRECTION PROCEDURE WITH A CODED MESSAGE REFERENCE.
    FURTHER GENERATION OF THE CURRENT DATA SET IS TERMINATED, AND GENERATION
    OF THE NEXT DATA SET (IF ANY) IS INITIATED.
    CODED MESSAGE REFERENCES ARE ALWAYS IN THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:

         THE STATEMENT CAN BE CODED THUS:
         //DSGPRINT     DD   SYSOUT=A
0   3.   DSGOUT01 DD STATEMENT
         ---------------------
         THIS IS USED TO DESCRIBE THE DATA SET WHICH IS TO BE CREATED
         BY THE DATA SET GENERATOR.  THE USER SHOULD SUPPLY SUCH PARAMETERS
         AS DSNAME, DISP, UNIT, VOLUME, SPACE, ETC. AS APPROPRIATE, AND MUST
         SUPPLY A DCB PARAMETER TO DESCRIBE THE RECORD FORMAT, BLOCK SIZE
         AND RECORD SIZE.
0   4.   SYSIN DD STATEMENT
         ------------------
         THE SYSIN DD STATEMENT IS USED TO DESCRIBE THE USER DATA SET THAT
         CONTAINS CONTROL CARDS AND DATA CARDS.  USUALLY THIS WILL BE CODED
         AS
         //SYSIN        DD   *

         PRINTING OF GENERATED RECORDS;  DIAGNOSTIC MESSAGES AND ERROR MESSAGES
         ARE ALWAYS WRITTEN.
0        UTLGENER IS NOT LIMITED TO PRODUCING ONLY ONE DATA SET PER EXECUTION.
         UP TO 99 DATA SETS CAN BE GENERATED IN A SINGLE EXECUTION, AND THERE IS
         NO NECESSITY FOR THESE DATA SETS TO HAVE THE SAME DCB ATTRIBUTES.
         FOR EACH ADDITIONAL DATA SET WHICH IS TO BE CREATED, IT IS NECESSARY
         TO SUPPLY AN ADDITIONAL DD STATEMENT, AND THE APPROPRIATE CONTROL AND
         DATA CARDS.  THE DDNAMES OF ADDITIONAL DD STATEMENTS MUST BE CODED AS
