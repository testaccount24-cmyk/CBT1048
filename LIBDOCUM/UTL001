01. PURPOSE
 ----------
0   THE PROGRAM PRINTS LOGICAL RECORDS OF ANY SEQUENTIAL DATA SET.
    THE FORMAT OF THE PRINTED OUTPUT CAN BE CONTROLLED BY THE USER AS
    FOLLOWS, BY SPECIFYING:-
0        (A)  WHETHER THE OUTPUT SHOULD BE IN CHARACTER,
              HEXADECIMAL OR DUMP FORMAT.
0        (B)  ONE, TWO OR THREE LINE FEEDS ON THE PRINTER.
0        (C)  THE NUMBER OF LINES TO BE PRINTED PER PAGE.
0        (D)  AT WHAT RECORD PRINTING SHOULD COMMENCE.
0        (E)  HOW MANY RECORDS SHOULD BE PRINTED.
0   THE USER ALSO HAS A LIMITED CONTROL OVER THE EDITING OF THE
    PRINTED OUTPUT.
02. LIMITATIONS
 --------------
    WILL ONLY ACCESS FILES SEQUENTIALLY.
03. INPUT DATA
 -------------
    ONE SEQUENTIAL DATA SET TO BE LISTED.
04. OUTPUT DATA
 --------------
    REQUESTED PRINTER LISTING.
05. OPERATION
 ------------
0   THREE JOB CONTROL STATEMENTS ARE REQUIRED FOR EXECUTION OF THE
    PROGRAM:
0        //        EXEC PGM=UTL001
         //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A
         //LISTDATA DD (INPUT DD INFORMATION)
0   (UTL001 HAS AN ALIAS OF UT401, HENCE // EXEC PGM=UT401 IS AN
    ALTERNATIVE).
0   THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PARAMETERS WHICH MAY BE SUPPLIED TO THE
    PROGRAM VIA THE EXECUTE CARD.  THEY ARE POSITIONAL PARAMETERS
    AND MUST APPEAR IN THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE:
0        PARM=(A,B,C,D,E)
0   EACH PARAMETER IS DISCUSSED SEPARATELY ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE.
1************
 * UTL001   *
 ************
0   A.   THE VALUE OF THIS PARAMETER CONTROLS WHETHER THE PRINTED
         OUTPUT IS TO BE IN CHARACTER, HEXADECIMAL OR DUMP FORMAT.
0        A= 1,2 OR 3,  SIGNIFIES THAT THE OUTPUT IS CHARACTER, WITH
         ONE, TWO OR THREE LINE FEEDS BETWEEN EACH PRINTED LINE.
0        A= X,  SIGNIFIES THAT THE OUTPUT IS TO BE HEXADECIMAL, WITH
         AN AUTOMATIC ONE LINE FEED BETWEEN EACH PRINTED LINE.
         EACH LINE WILL BE PRINTED AS TWELVE BLOCKS OF EIGHT
         HEXADECIMAL CHARACTERS.
0        A= XX,  SIGNIFIES THAT THE OUTPUT IS TO BE HEXADECIMAL,
         WITH AN AUTOMATIC ONE LINE FEED BETWEEN EACH PRINTED LINE.
         EACH LINE WILL BE PRINTED AS CONTIGUOUS BYTES WITHOUT
         INTERVENING BLANKS.
0        A= D,  SIGNIFIES THAT THE OUTPUT IS TO BE IN DUMP FORMAT,
         WITH AN AUTOMATIC ONE LINE FEED BETWEEN EACH PRINTED LINE.
0        (THE DUMP FORMAT IS SIMILAR TO A 360 STORAGE DUMP PRINTOUT -
         I.E., SHOWING BOTH HEXADECIMAL AND CHARACTER).
0        EACH LINE OF THE HEXADECIMAL PORTION WILL BE PRINTED AS
         EIGHT BLOCKS OF EIGHT HEXADECIMAL CHARACTERS.
0        A= DD,  SIGNIFIES THAT THE OUTPUT IS TO BE IN DUMP FORMAT
         WITH AN AUTOMATIC ONE LINE FEED BETWEEN EACH PRINTED LINE.
0        EACH LINE OF THE HEXADECIMAL PORTION WILL BE PRINTED AS
         CONTIGUOUS BYTES WITHOUT INTERVENING BLANKS.
0        BY DEFAULT, A VALUE OF 1 IS ASSUMED.
0   B.   THE VALUE OF THIS PARAMETER CAN BE 1 TO 99 INCLUSIVE.
         IT CONTROLS THE NUMBER OF LINES TO BE PRINTED PER PAGE.
0        BY DEFAULT, A VALUE OF 55 IS ASSUMED FOR CHARACTER PRINT;
         OR 60 FOR HEXADECIMAL AND DUMP PRINTS.
0        PARAMETER CAN BE ONE OR TWO DIGITS IN LENGTH.
0   C.   THE VALUE OF THIS PARAMETER CAN BE 1 TO 99999 INCLUSIVE.  IT
         CONTROLS THE STARTING POINT WITHIN THE DATA SET WHERE
         PRINTING SHOULD COMMENCE (I.E., RECORD NUMBER).
0        BY DEFAULT IT IS ASSUMED THAT PRINTING SHOULD START FROM THE
         1ST RECORD OF THE DATA SET.
0        PARAMETER CAN BE ONE TO FIVE DIGITS IN LENGTH.
0   D.   THE VALUE OF THIS PARAMETER CAN BE 1 TO 99999 INCLUSIVE.  IT
         CONTROLS THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF RECORDS TO BE PRINTED.
0        BY DEFAULT IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE DATA SET SHOULD BE PRINTED
         UP TO THE NATURAL END OF FILE.
0        PARAMETER CAN BE ONE TO FIVE DIGITS IN LENGTH.

 * UTL001   *
 ************
0   E.   THE VALUE OF THIS PARAMETER CAN BE ANY NON-BLANK CHARACTER.
         IT CONTROLS WHETHER OR NOT THE PAGE HEADING SHOULD APPEAR.
         THIS APPLIES TO CHARACTER PRINTS ONLY.  THE HEADING IS
         AUTOMATICALLY OMITTED ON HEXADECIMAL AND DUMP PRINTS.
0        BY DEFAULT IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE PAGE HEADING SHOULD APPEAR.
0                            * * * *
0        THE FOLLOWING RULES APPLY TO PARAMETERS PLACED IN THE
    EXECUTE CARD.
0   1.   IF MULTIPLE PARAMETERS ARE SUPPLIED, THEY MUST BE LISTED
         IN THE SEQUENCE AS SHOWN ABOVE AND THEY MUST BE SEPARATED
         BY COMMAS AND ENCLOSED IN PARENTHESES AND HAVE NO
         INTERVENING BLANKS.
0        IF PARAMETERS ARE OMITTED IN ORDER THAT THE ASSUMED VALUE BE
         USED, A COMMA MUST BE INSERTED TO INDICATE POSITION OF
         ASSUMED PARAMETERS.
0        I.E.,  PARM=(,30,,200)        - CHARACTER WITH 1 LINE FEED, 30 LINES
                                         TO A PAGE, PRINT FROM 1ST RECORD,
                                         PRINT A MAXIMUM OF 200 LOGICAL RECORDS.
0               PARM=(X,,,50)          - HEXADECIMAL, 60 LINES TO A PAGE,
                                         PRINT FROM 1ST RECORD, PRINT A
                                         MAXIMUM OF 50 LOGICAL RECORDS.
0               PARM=(,,,,N)           - CHARACTER WITH 1 LINE FEED, 55 LINES
                                         TO A PAGE, PRINT FROM 1ST RECORD,
                                         PRINT ENTIRE DATA SET, OMIT HEADING
                                         AT TOP OF PAGES.
0               PARM=(DD,,100)         - DUMP WITH NO INTERVENING BLANKS,
                                         60 LINES TO A PAGE, START PRINTING
                                         FROM 100TH RECORD, PRINT TO NATURAL
                                         END OF FILE.
0        THE ABSENCE OF THE PARM ENTRY ON THE EXECUTE CARD WILL CAUSE
         ALL ASSUMED VALUES TO BE USED.
0   2.   INVALID OR IMPROPERLY FORMATTED PARAMETERS WILL CAUSE AN
         ABNORMAL END TO BE TAKEN, WITH A USER COMPLETION CODE OF
         999.
