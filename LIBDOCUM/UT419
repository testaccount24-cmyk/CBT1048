01. PURPOSE
 ----------
0   THIS SUBROUTINE COMPRESSES A 40-BYTE FIELD INTO A 20-BYTE
    FIELD WITH TWO CHARACTERS PER BYTE, OR UNPACKS THE COMPRESSED
    FIELD INTO THE 40-BYTE FIELD.
0   THIS DIFFERS FROM THE NORMAL PACK OPERATION IN THAT THE
    COMPRESSED FIELD IS PACKED WITHOUT A SIGN IN THE RIGHT-MOST
    HALF-BYTE.
02. LIMITATIONS
 --------------
0   NONE.
03. INPUT DATA
 -------------
0   NONE.
04. OUTPUT DATA
 --------------
0   NONE.
05. OPERATION
 ------------
0   THE CODING REQUIRED TO CALL UT419 FROM A COBOL PROGRAM IS
0   ENTER LINKAGE.
    CALL 'UT419' USING DATA-NAME.
    ENTER COBOL.
0   WHERE DATA-NAME IS A GROUP ITEM OF THE FORM
0   01   PARAMETER.
         03   INPUT                    PICTURE X(40).
         03   OUTPUT                   PICTURE X(20).
         03   ERROR-SWITCH             PICTURE 9.
         03   OPERATION                PICTURE X.
0   UT419 CAN PERFORM TWO OPERATIONS:-
0   P  - THE DATA IN THE FIELD INPUT IS COMPRESSED, AND PLACED IN
         THE FIELD OUTPUT.  IF A BLANK (HEXADECIMAL 40) IS ENCOUNTERED
         IN INPUT,  HEXADECIMAL F IS PLACED IN THE CORRESPONDING
         HALF-BYTE IN OUTPUT.  IF A NUMBER (I.E. A CHARACTER IN THE
         HEXADECIMAL RANGE FO-F9) IS ENCOUNTERED IN INPUT, THE
         DIGIT PORTION OF THE SOURCE BYTE IS PLACED IN THE CORRESPONDING
         HALF-BYTE OF OUTPUT.  IF ANY OTHER CHARACTER IS ENCOUNTERED,
         A HEXADECIMAL A IS PLACED IN OUTPUT.
0   U  - THE DATA IN THE FIELD OUTPUT IS EXPANDED, AND PLACED IN THE
         FIELD INPUT.  IF A HALF-BYTE IN OUTPUT IS FOUND TO CONTAIN
         A DIGIT (HEXADECIMAL 0 - 9), A CHARACTER IN THE RANGE
         HEXADECIMAL F0 - F9 IS PLACED IN THE CORRESPONDING BYTE OF

0             INPUT.  IF A HALF-BYTE IN OUTPUT IS FOUND TO CONTAIN
              F, A BLANK (HEXADECIMAL 40) IS PLACED IN THE CORRESPONDING
              BYTE OF INPUT.  IF ANY OTHER HEXADECIMAL CHARACTER
              (I.E. A - E) IS ENCOUNTERED IN A HALF BYTE OF OUTPUT, AN
              ASTERISK (HEXADECIMAL 5C) IS PLACED IN THE CORRESPONDING
              BYTE OF INPUT.
0        ERROR-SWITCH IS SET TO 1 IF NEITHER P NOR U IS SPECIFIED IN
         OPERATION, BUT OTHERWISE IT IS SET TO ZERO (I.E. UT419 ALWAYS
         COMPLETES ITS PACK OR UNPACK OPERATION, NO MATTER WHAT THE
         DATA IT IS GIVEN TO PROCESS).
0        NOTE THAT UT419 ALWAYS PACKS THE ENTIRE 40-BYTE INPUT FIELD
         FOR A P OPERATION, AND ALWAYS UNPACKS THE ENTIRE 20-BYTE
         OUTPUT FIELD FOR A U OPERATION, SO IT IS THE PROGRAMMER'S
         RESPONSIBILITY TO ACCESS AS MUCH OF THESE FIELDS AS IS RELEVANT
         TO HIM.
0   RPG  OPERATION
    --------------
0   IF UT419 IS CALLED BY RPG IT IS NECESSARY TO DEFINE THE PARAMETER
    AREA IN A SERIES OF RLABLS, WITH THE FIRST FIELD NAMED PARAM, AS
    SHOWN IN THE ATTACHED CODING.  THE FIRST TIME RPG PASSES CONTROL
    TO THE SUBROUTINE THE FIELD ERROR MUST CONTAIN R TO INDICATE THAT
    RPG IS THE CALLING LANGUAGE.
