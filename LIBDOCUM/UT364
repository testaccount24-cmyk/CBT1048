01. PURPOSE
 ----------
0   THE FREE FORMAT OPTION FREES THE PROGRAMMER FROM THE
    NEED TO KNOW THE EXACT PLACEMENT OF HIS DATA ON THE
    INPUT CARDS.
02. RESTRICTIONS
 ---------------
0   A.   DATA ITEMS MUST BE SEPARATED BY ONE OR MORE BLANKS.
0   B.   A DATA ITEM MUST NOT BE SPREAD OVER TWO CARDS.
         HOWEVER, ONE READ CAN PROCESS MORE THAN ONE CARD.
03. USAGE
 --------
0   THE FREE FORMAT OPTION IS BROUGHT INTO USE WHEN A G1.0
    FIELD IS FOUND IN A FORMAT STATEMENT.  THIS SPECIFICATION
    CAN BE IN EITHER A VARIABLE OR FIXED FORMAT.  THE ONLY
    RESTRICTION IS THAT IT SHOULD BE THE LAST OR ONLY
    SPECIFICATION IN THE FORMAT SINCE THE FORMAT SCAN IS
    STOPPED AFTER SUCH A FIELD IS FOUND.
0   AFTER THE PROGRAM CALCULATES THE WIDTH OF THE DATA ITEM,
    IT SETS UP A FORMAT ITEM AS FOLLOWS.  GN.0 WHERE "N"
    IS THE CALCULATED WIDTH.  THUS ANY QUESTION AS TO THE
    TYPE OF CONVERSION WHICH IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE CAN BE
    ANSWERED BY ASSUMING A FORMAT OF THIS TYPE.  SUCH
    FORMAT ITEMS ARE DESCRIBED IN THE IBM S/360 FORTRAN IV
    LANGUAGE MANUAL (FORM C28-6515).
0   NORMALLY THE PROGRAM WILL SCAN ALL 80 COLUMNS OF AN
    INPUT CARD.  IF THIS IS NOT DESIRABLE, AN * CAN BE
    PLACED IN THE CARD COLUMN IN WHICH THE SCAN IS TO STOP.
    UPON FINDING THE *, THE PROGRAM WILL GET A NEW RECORD
    AND CONTINUE OPERATING AS BEFORE.
         CAUTION:  DO NOT USE THE ASTERISK ON A CARD WHICH
                   IS TO BE READ AGAIN OR ON A CARD IMMEDIATELY
                   PRECEDING A CARD TO BE READ AGAIN.
0   IF THE PROGRAMMER DOES NOT WISH TO READ ALL THE VARIABLES
    WHICH ARE MENTIONED IN A READ STATEMENT, HE CAN OMIT
    CERTAIN LIST ELEMENTS BY PLACING AN INTEGER (N) IMMED-
    IATELY FOLLOWED BY AN EQUAL SIGN IN THE INPUT STREAM,
    THUS CAUSING THE PROGRAM TO OMIT THE NEXT N ITEMS IN
    THE LIST.  IF AN ARRAY IS BEING PROCESSED, THEN THE
    NEXT N ELEMENTS OF THE ARRAY ARE OMITTED.  ELEMENTS
    WHICH ARE OMITTED ARE NOT ASSIGNED NEW VALUES BUT RE-
    TAIN THE VALUE WHICH WAS LAST ASSIGNED TO THEM.

04. RE-READ OPTION
 -----------------
0   THIS OPTION ALLOWS THE PROGRAMMER TO READ AGAIN THE
    LAST LOGICAL RECORD THAT WAS PROCESSED.  A READ WITH
    FORMAT STATEMENT WILL CAUSE A POINTER TO BE SAVED TO
    THE BUFFER OF THE DATA.  A SUBSEQUENT 'READ (12,FORMAT)
    LIST' WILL CAUSE THE SAME DATA FROM THE BUFFER USED
    BY THE LAST READ WITH FORMAT TO BE TRANSMITTED TO THE
    'LIST' WITH CONVERSION CALLED FOR BY THE FORMAT.
0   IF A PROGRAMMER WISHES TO CONVERT DATA WHICH WAS NOT
    READ IN BY THE LAST READ, HE CAN FILL A DUMMY BUFFER
    BY USING A WRITE WITH FORMAT SPECIFYING DATA SET
    REFERENCE NUMBER 12,E.G. 'WRITE (12,FORMAT) LIST'. A
    SUBSEQUENT 'READ (12,FORMAT) LIST' WILL READ THE DUMMY
    BUFFER WHICH WAS FILLED BY THE PRECEDING WRITE WITH
    FORMAT AND DATA SET REFERENCE NUMBER 12.
0   THE DUMMY BUFFER ASSUMES A CARD IMAGE (80 BYTES).
    ANY ATTEMPT TO LOAD MORE INFORMATION THAN THIS WILL
    CAUSE SERIOUS ERRORS TO OCCUR.
05. FORTRAN PROCEDURES
 ---------------------
0   ALL FORTRAN JCL PROCEDURES WHICH USE THE LINKAGE EDITOR
    OR LOADER HAVE BEEN MODIFIED TO INCLUDE A SYMBOLIC PARA-
    METER FOR THE PRIMARY LINKAGE EDITOR/LOADER AUTOMATIC
    CALL LIBRARY.
0   THIS PARAMETER - LKLBDSN - DEFAULTS TO SYS1.FORTLIB FOR
    ALL LEVELS OF FORTRAN.  IF THE G1.0/RE-READ FACILITY IS
    REQUIRED CODE LKLBDSN='SYS2.REREAD' ON THE EXEC CARD,
    E.G.
0   //STEP1 EXEC FORTGCLG,LKLBDSN='SYS2.REREAD'
06. MOPP SYSTEM
 --------------
0   AS FROM 1ST AUGUST 1976 THE MOPP SYSTEM WILL RECOGNISE THE
    FOLLOWING LANGUAGES CODES FOR FORTRAN WITH GI.0/REREAD PRO-
    CESSING:
0        FRTER     -    FORTRAN   'E' LEVEL
0        FRTGR     -       "      'G'   "
0        FRTHR     -       "      'H'   "
