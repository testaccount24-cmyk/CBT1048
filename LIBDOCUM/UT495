01) PURPOSE :
    -------
    THE CENTRAL OPERATIONS TERMINAL WHICH IS CONNECTED TO
    THE ST. LOUIS SYSTEM CAN PRODUCE PRINT-OUT ON HARD-COPY
    OR ON MAGNETIC TAPE.  DISTRIBUTION OF HARD-COPY WITHIN
    EUROPE IS A TIME CONSUMING PROCESS, BUT UNTIL NOW THERE
    HAS BEEN NO SATISFACTORY METHOD OF TRANSFERRING PRINT
    FILES FROM MAGNETIC TAPE ONTO THE MONSANTO EUROPE COMPUTER
    SERVICES HASP NETWORK.  UT495 HAS BEEN WRITTEN TO PROVIDE
    AN INTERFACE BETWEEN THE DATA 100 TERMINAL WHICH CREATES
    133 BYTE RECORDS AND THE HASP SYSTEM WHICH CAN ONLY READ
    80 BYTE CARD IMAGE RECORDS.
0   UT495 WILL REFORMAT ANY SEQUENTIAL DATA SET WITH FIXED
    LENGTH RECORDS INTO 80 BYTE PSEUDO CARD-IMAGES FOR TRANSMIS-
    SION OVER A HASP RJE NETWORK, AND WILL RECONSTITUTE A
    PSEUDO CARD-IMAGE FILE BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL FORMAT.  PRINT
    FILES FROM THE DATA 100 MAGNETIC TAPE TERMINAL ARE TREATED
    AS A SPECIAL CASE AND ARE RE-FORMATTED AS PART OF A JOB-
    STREAM FOR INPUT TO THE HASP INTERNAL READER, ALL THE
    JOB CONTROL LANGUAGE NECESSARY TO RECONSTITUTE THE OUTPUT
    AS PRINT LINES ROUTED TO A EUROPEAN TERMINAL BEING GENERATED
    WITHIN THE PROGRAM FROM INFORMATION IN THE ST. LOUIS HASP
    SEPARATOR PAGE.

02) LIMITATIONS :
    -----------
    UT495 WILL ONLY PROCESS SEQUENTIAL FILES WITH FIXED
    LENGTH RECORDS, BLOCKED BY ANY FACTOR.  OTHER FILES
    MAY BE CONVERTED TO 80 BYTE CARD-IMAGES BY THE IBM
    UTILITIES IEHMOVE OR IEBISAM OR EQUIVALENT PROGRAMS
    SUCH AS LYNETTE.

03) PARM OPTIONS :
    ------------
0   THE FUNCTION TO BE PERFORMED WILL BE SPECIFIED BY THE
    PARM KEYWORD OPTYPE.
0   OPTYPE=RF                - RE-FORMAT A SEQUENTIAL DATA SET
                               INTO PSEUDO CARD-IMAGES.
0   OPTYPE=RC                - RECONSTITUTE A SEQUENTIAL DATA SET
                               INTO ITS ORIGINAL FORMAT FROM
                               PSEUDO CARD-IMAGES CREATED BY THE
                               UT495 OPTYPE=RF FUNCTION.
0   OPTYPE=PO                - INPUT IS A PRINT TAPE TO BE
                               REFORMATTED WITH THE JCL REQUIRED
                               TO RECONSTITUTE THE DATA AS PRINT
                               LINES.

04) INPUT :
    -----
0   A)   SYSIN (OPTYPE=RF ONLY) :
         -----
         THIS OPTIONAL DATA SET DEFINES AN AUXILIARY INPUT
         FILE OF CARD-IMAGES WHICH WILL BE COPIED DIRECTLY
         TO THE OUTPUT DATA SET WITHOUT ANY PROCESSING.  IT
         WILL NORMALLY DEFINE JOB CONTROL LANGUAGE STATEMENTS
         TO RECONSTITUTE THE MAIN INPUT DATA.
         A CONTROL CARD OF THE FORMAT :
         %%%D A T A%%%
         STARTING IN CARD COLUMN 1 INDICATES THE POSITION
         THAT THE REFORMATTED PSEUDO CARD-IMAGES WILL OCCUPY
         IN THE OUTPUT.
         THE CONTROL CARD ITSELF IS NOT COPIED TO THE OUTPUT
         FILE THE FIRST TIME THAT IT OCCURS, BUT SECOND OR
         SUBSEQUENT OCCURRENCIES OF THE CONTROL CARD WILL BE
         TREATED AS AUXILIARY DATA AND WILL BE COPIED EXACTLY
         TO THE OUTPUT STREAM.
         BECAUSE UT495 CREATES PSEUDO CARD-IMAGES OF THE MAIN
         INPUT DATA WHICH CONTAIN BOTH DATA AND CONTROL INFOR-
         MATION THE SYSIN DATA SET MAY NOT BE USED TO CREATE
         ADDITIONAL DATA RECORDS : IT SHOULD BE LIMITED TO JOB
         CONTROL LANGUAGE STATEMENTS ONLY.
0   B)   SYSUT1 (OPTYPE=RF) :
         ------
         MANDATORY DATA SET WHICH DEFINES THE SEQUENTIAL, FIXED
         LENGTH RECORD DATA SET WHICH WILL BE REFORMATTED AS
         PSEUDO CARD-IMAGES OF 80 BYTES.
0   C)   SYSUT1 (OPTYPE=RC) :
         ------
         MANDATORY DATA SET WHICH DEFINES A DATA SET OF PSEUDO
         CARD-IMAGES CREATED BY UT495.  NO OTHER FORMAT OF
         INPUT IS ALLOWED FOR THE RECONSTITUTE OPERATION.

04) INPUT : (CONT'D)
    -----
0   D)   SYSUT1 (OPTYPE=PO) :
         ------
         MANDATORY DATA SET WHICH DEFINES A DATA 100 PRINT
         TAPE CONTAINING ANY NUMBER OF JOBS IN THE FORMAT :
         TAPE MARK, SEPARATOR PAGE, REPORTS, SEPARATOR PAGE,
         TAPE MARK, SEPARATOR PAGE, REPORTS, ETC.. THE TAPE
         IS TERMINATED BY TWO CONSECUTIVE TAPE MARKS.  THE
         RECORDS ARE FBA, 133 BYTE RECORDS IN 3990 BYTE BLOCKS.
         INPUT FILES WHICH DO NOT CONFORM TO THIS FORMAT ARE
         IGNORED.

05) OUTPUT :
    ------
    A)   SYSPRINT :
         --------
         OPTIONAL MESSAGE DATA SET.  THERE ARE TWO TYPES
         OF REPORT : OPTYPE=PO FUNCTIONS PRODUCE A REPORT
         OF JOBS CREATED SPECIFYING JOB NAME, PROGRAMMER
         NAME, REMOTE ROUTE, SPECIAL FORMS REQUESTS AND RECORD
         COUNTS.  OTHER FUNCTIONS PRODUCE A ONE LINE REPORT
         GIVING DATA SET NAME AND FORMAT OF THE ORIGINAL INPUT
         FILE TOGETHER WITH RECORD COUNTS.  IT IS EMPHASISED
         THAT FOR OPTYPE=RC OPERATIONS THE DATA SET NAME AND
         FORMAT ACTUALLY CREATED MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE
         OF THE ORIGINAL FILE AS SHOWN ON THE REPORT.
0   B)   SYSUT2 (OPTYPE=PO) :
         ------
         CARD IMAGE JOB STREAM OF FORMAT SUITABLE FOR SUBMISSION
         VIA THE HASP INTERNAL READER, I.E.
         DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=80,BUFNO=1).
         THE LAST RECORD IS A /*EOF CARD TO SIGNIFY END-OF-
         FILE TO THE HASP INTERNAL READER.  IF REQUIRED, THE
         BLOCK SIZE MAY BE OVERRIDDEN IN THE SYSUT2 DD CARD,
         IF OUTPUT IS NOT IN FACT BEING DIRECTED TO UNIT=INTRDR.
         THE JOB CARD GENERATED IS CONSTRUCTED FROM THE ST. LOUIS
         HASP SEPARATOR PAGE, AS FOLLOWS :
         THE JOB NAME AND PROGRAMMER NAME FIELDS ARE COPIED
         DIRECTLY.
         IF THE PROGRAMMER NAME FIELD IS OF THE FORMAT SFXXXX,
         THEN XXXX IS SPECIFIED AS THE JOB FORMS IN THE HASP
         ACCOUNTING INFORMATION.
         THE JOB IS DEEMED TO BE PRODUCTION.
         TO REDUCE THE VOLUME OF PRINT-OUT MSGLEVEL=(0,0) IS
         USED AND NO SYSPRINT DATA SET IS DEFINED.

0   B)   SYSUT2 (OPTYPE=PO) : (CONT'D)
         ------
         A /*ROUTE PRINT REMOTENN CARD IS GENERATED WHERE NN
         IS THE ST. LOUIS BIN NUMBER.  IF THIS IS NOT A VALID
         REMOTE NUMBER REMOTE 14 (CENTRAL OPERATIONS) IS
         SUBSTITUTED.  THE JOB STREAM EXECUTES UT495 WITH THE
         OPTYPE=RC OPTION TO RECONSTITUTE AS PRINT OUTPUT ON
         THE MONSANTO EUROPE HASP SYSTEM PSEUDO CARD-IMAGES
         CREATED FROM THE TAPE OUTPUT FROM THE MONSANTO ST. LOUIS
         HASP SYSTEM.
0   C)   SYSUT2 (OPTYPE=RF) :
         ------
         MANDATORY OUTPUT DATA SET CONSISTING OF DATA AS
         DEFINED BY SYSIN (IF ANY) AND 80 BYTE PSEUDO CARD-
         IMAGES CONTAINING DATA FROM THE SYSUT1 INPUT AND CONTROL
         INFORMATION TO ENABLE IT TO BE RECONSTITUTED.  THE
         DEFAULT BLOCK SIZE OF 400 MAY BE OVERRIDDEN.
0   D)   SYSUT2 (OPTYPE=RC) :
         ------
         MANDATORY OUTPUT DATA SET WHICH WILL BE RECONSTITUTED
         FROM THE PSEUDO CARD IMAGES CREATED BY A RUN OF UT495
         WITH OPTYPE=RF.  THE DCB INFORMATION WILL BE COPIED FROM
         THE ORIGINAL DATA SET, BUT THE BLKSIZE MAY BE OVERRIDDEN.

06) COMPLETION CODES :
    ----------------
    UT495 WILL RETURN COMPLETION CODES TO INDICATE WHETHER
    THE OPERATION WAS SUCCESSFUL OR THE REASON FOR FAILING.
    IF A SYSPRINT MESSAGE DATA SET IS PRESENT, A BRIEF
    EXPLANATORY MESSAGE WILL BE PRINTED.  THE COMPLETION CODES
    ARE :
0   0  - GOOD END OF PROGRAM.
    4  - INVALID PARM REQUEST.
    8  - MANDATORY SYSUT1 OR SYSUT2 FILE NOT DEFINED.
    12 - INPUT IS INCORRECT FORMAT.
    16 - I/O ERROR OCCURRED, POSSIBLY BECAUSE SYSUT1 WAS NOT
         DEFINED.
0   IF AN ABEND U0495 OCCURS CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT GROUP.

07) ST. LOUIS OPERATION :
    -------------------
    UT495 IS AVAILABLE ON THE ST. LOUIS SYSTEM BY USE
    OF A STEPLIB CARD SPECIFYING THE LIBRARY BXL.LINKLIB.
0   THE FOLLOWING IS OFFERED AS AN EXAMPLE OF TRANSFERRING
    DATA - IN THIS CASE A PRINT FILE - FROM THE BRUSSELS
    SYSTEM TO THE ST. LOUIS SYSTEM.  THIS JCL IS COMPLEX
    AND SHOULD BE STUDIED VERY CAREFULLY.
