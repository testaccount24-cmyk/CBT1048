01. PURPOSE
 ----------
0   THIS PROGRAM WAS WRITTEN TO SERVE AS A PROGRAM CHECKOUT
    AID.  IN THE SITUATION WHERE A PROGRAM IS BEING DEVELOPED
    TO PROCESS A LARGE EXISTING FILE, B3303 WILL CREATE A
    REPRESENTATIVE MINIFILE FOR TESTING PURPOSES.
02. LIMITATIONS
 --------------
0   THIS UTILITY PROGRAM IS APPLICABLE ONLY TO SEQUENTIAL
    FILES.
03. INPUT
 --------
0   A.   THE INPUT DATA SET (SYSUT1) MAY BE ON TAPE OR DISK.
         DISK FILES AND STANDARD LABELED TAPES DO NOT NEED
         DCB PARAMETERS.
0   B.   THE SAMPLING "PERIOD" IS SPECIFIED IN THE PARM FIELD
         OF THE EXEC STATEMENT.  THIS FIELD MUST BE NUMERIC.
         FOR EXAMPLE, PARM=(10) SPECIFIES THAT EVERY TENTH
         RECORD WILL BE COPIED TO THE OUTPUT DATA SET.
04. OUTPUT
 ---------
0   THE OUTPUT DATA SET (SYSUT2) MAY BE DISK, TAPE, OR
    SYSOUT TO THE PRINTER.  THE OUTPUT RECORD LENGTH NEED
    NOT BE THE SAME AS THE INPUT.  IF THE OUTPUT LRECL IS
    GREATER THAN THE INPUT LRECL, HEX ZEROS WILL BE USED AS
    PADDING TO LENGTHEN THE RECORD.  IF THE OUTPUT LRECL IS
    LESS THAN THE INPUT LRECL, THE RECORD WILL BE TRUNCATED.
    IF NO OUTPUT DCB IS PRESENT, THE INPUT LRECL, BLKSIZE,
    AND RECFM ARE ASSUMED FOR OUTPUT.
05. EXAMPLE
 ----------
0   COPY STANDARD LABELED TAPE TO DISK SELECTING EVERY 25TH
    RECORD.  USE THE INPUT DCB'S LRECL, BLKSIZE, AND RECFM
    FOR THE OUTPUT DATA SET.
